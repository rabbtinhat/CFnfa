                    <p>Armed with a degree from the University of Hong Kong, CF debated equity valuations like a pro—while relatives mistook his passion for "gambling." Little did they know, CF will soon turn "gambling" into a career.</p>

                    <h2>Equity Samurai & Asset Allocation Ninja: Everywhere was a Dojo</h2>
                    <p>At EFG Bank, CF turned himself into a machine, handling hundreds of trade orders everyday. He also became a spreadsheet ninja, slaying trade discrepancies with Excel macros and broker negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Then, at China Citic Bank, CF morphed into a "Portfolio Yoda", training rookies on market trends while dodging regulatory Sith Lords. His secret? Turning Sharpe ratios into bedtime stories. Bonus: surviving 2013–2015 on coffee and Bloomberg Terminal alerts.</p>

                    <p>At HSBC Private Banking and BMO Private Bank HK, CF played the role as a "wealth therapist" to high-net-worth clients, aligning portfolios with risk appetites.</p>
                    <p>Secret talent: convincing billionaires that "diversification" isn't code for "boring." Meanwhile, his CFA charter arrived—finally, a license to geek out legally and obtained one of the most epic names: CF, CFA.</p>

                    <h2>Career Break: Masters, Mountains, and Cards</h2>
                    <p>Since the outbreak of Covid, CF started to questioned himself about the meaning of life. He then rage-quit the career he has been longing for years, to hike trails, debate tax policy and catch bluffs in Auckland. Earned a Master's in Taxation, grinded poker tables, mastered reading "tells" in markets and humans.</p>

                    <h2>From Poker Tables to Blockchain and AI</h2>
                    <p>Relocating again, to Canada this time, CF is merging poker grit with blockchain brains. Participated in different Web3 projects, and started training his AI agents to predict the market (...they still can't).</p>
                    <p>Now CF is a "decentralization DJ," spinning Defi podcasts and DAO meetups. Secret mission: Convert Tim Hortons regulars into Bitcoin Maxis. Latest flex: Turning his CFA into a "Crypto Finance Authority" badge.</p>
