                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities ended a volatile week mixed, with the Dow and S&P 500 up 0.5%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.7% but entered correction territory. Markets reacted to February’s softer jobs report (151K vs. 160K expected) and Fed Chair Powell’s insistence on delaying rate cuts. Trade uncertainty persisted as Trump paused tariffs on Canada/Mexico, though retaliatory risks lingered. Tesla plunged 11% weekly, nearing 50% below its December peak amid Musk-Trump political ties. Money market funds hit a record $7 trillion as investors sought safety. Energy rallied on Trump’s Russia sanction threats, lifting oil above $67/bbl.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced pressure as the ECB cut rates by 25bps to 2.5%, signaling less restrictive policy amid growth concerns. Germany’s DAX rose 1.47% to a record high despite broader Stoxx 600 volatility. Bond yields spiked on Trump’s tariff threats and German fiscal policy shifts, with 10-year bund yields hitting 2008 levels. Trade-linked sectors wavered as EU-China tensions simmered over slowing exports. Auto and industrial stocks drew caution amid U.S. tariff exemptions for compliant USMCA goods. European investors balanced rate cuts against global trade risks, with defensive sectors gaining traction.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asia-Pacific markets fell sharply, tracking Wall Street’s tariff-driven selloff. Japan’s Nikkei sank 2.25% as JGB yields surged, while China’s exports grew just 2.3% YoY, missing forecasts. Beijing criticized U.S. tariffs, vowing retaliation if imposed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.8% on tech weakness, and South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 2.1% amid auto tariff fears. India’s Nifty 50 underperformed (-1.5%) as energy stocks retreated. Regional trade-sensitive economies braced for supply chain disruptions, with semiconductor and EV stocks under pressure from U.S.-China policy risks.

Tesla sank 11% weekly as Musk’s Trump ties sparked demand fears, with Wedbush defending its $550 target. S&P 500 added DoorDash and Williams-Sonoma, replacing BorgWarner and Celanese. AI sector volatility continued—Palantir dipped despite Army contracts, while Snowflake and BigBear.ai slumped on federal budget risks. Oracle and BioNTech earnings loom next week. Semiconductor ETFs slid 10% monthly, signaling sector caution despite long-term AI optimism.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    **Overview**: The cryptocurrency market displayed mixed performance, with major assets like Bitcoin (-3.95%) and Ethereum (-3.03%) facing daily declines, though Bitcoin retained a 3.09% weekly gain. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) held steady, reflecting muted volatility.  

**Highlights**: XRP (-7.92% daily, +12.19% weekly) and Cardano (-9.58% daily, +30.78% weekly) saw sharp contrasts between short-term corrections and strong weekly momentum. TRON (+1.35%) defied the broader downtrend, while Bitcoin Cash (+24.73% weekly) and Bitget Token (+14.04% weekly) highlighted sector-specific rallies.  

**Market Trend**: Bearish pressure dominated the 24-hour session, with 23 of the top 30 assets declining. However, select altcoins demonstrated resilience over the week, suggesting rotational interest. Elevated stablecoin volumes ($111B for USDT) signaled cautious capital movements. The market exhibited corrective moves after recent rallies, with Bitcoin’s dominance holding near $1.72T market cap despite short-term volatility.
