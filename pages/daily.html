                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities declined as President Trump’s 25% auto import tariffs stoked trade war fears, dragging the S&P 500 (-0.3%), Dow (-0.3%), and Nasdaq (-0.5%). Auto stocks like GM (-7%), Ford (-4%), and Stellantis (-1%) fell sharply, while Tesla (+0.4%) and Rivian (+7.6%) outperformed due to domestic production. GameStop (-22%) plunged after announcing a $1.3B debt raise to buy Bitcoin. Investors await February’s PCE inflation data amid concerns tariffs could exacerbate sticky inflation and delay Fed rate cuts. Semiconductor stocks (NVIDIA, AMD) extended year-to-date losses on AI demand doubts.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets dipped as EU auto stocks (Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen) slumped on U.S. tariff risks. The EU accelerated critical mineral projects, including Greece’s gallium extraction plant, to reduce reliance on China. The bloc’s 47 strategic projects aim to secure supply chains amid geopolitical tensions. U.S.-Ukraine investment talks added pressure, with the U.S. demanding veto power over Ukrainian infrastructure projects, complicating Kyiv’s EU alignment. Stoxx 600 fell 0.4%, with autos and tech underperforming. EU officials emphasized avoiding "Chinese lithium becoming the next Russian gas," highlighting efforts to balance trade resilience and green transition.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets declined, led by Japanese automakers (Toyota -2.5%, Honda -2%) on U.S. tariff risks. Japan’s PM criticized the move, warning of economic harm. China’s Alibaba (+3%) rose after launching a new AI model, though semiconductor stocks (TSMC, Samsung) lagged amid tech sector weakness. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.6% amid lingering trade tensions. South Korea’s KOSPI (-1.2%) mirrored regional losses as Hyundai (-4.3%) and Kia dropped. Investors monitored U.S.-China chip restrictions and EU mineral self-sufficiency plans, which could reshape Asia’s export-driven economies.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks underperformed as AI chipmakers (NVIDIA -1.7%, AMD -3%, Broadcom -3%) faced slowing data center demand and tariff risks. AppLovin (-20%) plunged after Muddy Waters alleged “scammy” practices, adding to short-seller scrutiny. SailPoint (-1%) fell despite strong earnings, reflecting IPO market volatility. Microsoft’s reported data center pullback and Alibaba’s “bubble” warning weighed on semiconductor sentiment. Tesla (+0.4%) and Rivian (+7.6%) bucked trends due to tariff insulation. EU critical mineral projects highlighted tech supply chain shifts, with Greece’s gallium plant targeting 2027 production to reduce reliance on China.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The crypto market showed mixed performance, with Bitcoin (+0.47%) and Ethereum (+0.43%) edging up slightly, while total market cap remained stable. Mid-caps outperformed, led by Solana (+8.9% weekly) and Avalanche (+18% weekly), suggesting continued appetite for riskier assets.  

2) Toncoin (+8.29%) and Sui (+7.6%) were top gainers, fueled by high volume spikes (+147% and +50% respectively). BNB surged 3.4% with 52% volume increase. Bitcoin Cash (-2.67%) and Pi (-23% weekly) underperformed despite broader stability.  

3) Layer-1 protocols (SOL, AVAX) and oracle tokens (Chainlink +10% weekly) showed sustained momentum. Market dominance shifted slightly from Bitcoin (-0.09%) to altcoins, with trading volume concentration moving from stablecoins to mid-caps. Large caps exhibited lower volatility (+0.4-0.5%) compared to double-digit weekly gains in select mid-caps, indicating rotational buying pressure beyond blue-chip assets.
