                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities ended higher, with the S&P 500 (+0.1%) and Nasdaq (+0.5%) snapping four-week losing streaks. Markets rebounded after President Trump hinted at tariff "flexibility" ahead of April 2 deadlines. Energy (+8% YTD) outperformed amid sector rotation, while FedEx (-6.5%) and Nike (-5.5%) sank on weak guidance. Boeing (+3.1%) rose on a defense contract win. Tesla (+5.3%) rebounded after Musk’s employee reassurance. Fed rate-cut expectations and mixed economic signals drove volatility, with defensive sectors (utilities, healthcare) gaining traction amid tariff uncertainty.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets were mixed, with defense stocks under pressure after Hanwha Aerospace’s (-15%) $2.5B rights offering sparked sector concerns. EU leaders pledged to boost competitiveness against U.S. tariffs, though trade-sensitive industrials lagged. Energy and financials stabilized, while automakers faced headwinds from tariff risks. The STOXX 600 edged up marginally, supported by defensive rotations. Political tensions over Trump’s trade policies and weaker eurozone industrial data weighed on sentiment, though ECB rate-cut speculation provided partial offset.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asia-Pacific markets declined, led by South Korea’s KOSPI as Hanwha Aerospace’s rights issue triggered a broad defense sector selloff. Japan’s Nikkei pared losses on yen weakness, while Chinese equities lagged amid tariff-related export worries. Cleveland-Cliffs’ U.S. factory idling deepened concerns over regional steel demand. India’s Nifty 50 underperformed due to FedEx’s weak outlook impacting logistics stocks. Investors remained cautious ahead of U.S. tariff deadlines, with energy and tech stocks mirroring U.S. volatility.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech saw mixed moves: Tesla (+5.3%) rebounded on retail investor inflows ($8B over 13 sessions) and Musk’s bullish AI/robotaxi rhetoric. Super Micro Computer (+7.8%) surged on JPMorgan’s AI server demand upgrade. Nvidia (-1%) dipped despite Quantum Day announcements, while quantum computing stocks (D-Wave -18%) sold off. Micron (-8%) fell on margin concerns despite strong earnings. Apple and Alphabet stabilized, but sector-wide uncertainty persisted amid tariff risks and FedEx’s warning of industrial slowdowns impacting chip demand. AI infrastructure and defense-tech themes remained focal points.

2) **Key movers**: BNB (+0.6% 24h, +8.44% 7d) and Hyperliquid (+8.7% 24h, +12.4% 7d) led gains, supported by rising volumes. Sui (-3.47%) and Pi (-7.58%) dropped sharply, with Pi’s weekly decline deepening to -33.89%. Toncoin (-2.5% 24h) retained weekly gains (+23.64%), signaling profit-taking after a rally.  

3) **Dominant trends**: Layer 1 tokens diverged: Solana (+1.44% 24h, -3.85% 7d) underperformed vs. Ethereum’s weekly uptrend (+2.76%). Stablecoin volumes spiked (USDT: $48.2B), indicating hedging. Mid-caps like Polkadot (+8.35% 7d) and Aptos (+8.72% 7d) showed sustained momentum, while large caps consolidated. Market-wide 24h volume declined vs. prior day, suggesting cautious sentiment.
