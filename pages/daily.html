                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities fell sharply, with the Nasdaq entering correction territory (-2.6%) as tech stocks led declines. Tariff uncertainty weighed on sentiment after Trump paused auto tariffs for Canada/Mexico but hinted at broader levies. The Dow dropped 1% (-400 pts), while the S&P 500 slid 1.8%. Marvell Technology’s weak AI sales forecast (-19%) dragged chipmakers (Nvidia, AMD) lower, though Broadcom surged 10% post-market on strong guidance. Gap outperformed (+8%) by managing tariff impacts. Focus shifted to Friday’s jobs report amid stagflation fears, with weekly jobless claims at 221K, slightly below expectations.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European equities rallied, led by Germany’s DAX (+3.4%), which hit a record high after lawmakers proposed fiscal reforms to boost defense spending, triggering a bond selloff. The 10-year German yield spiked 30 bps Wednesday, its largest jump since reunification. The ECB cut rates to 2.5% but struck a cautious tone, signaling policy is “less restrictive.” EU bond yields rose broadly amid inflation fears from tariffs and fiscal expansion. The euro strengthened 0.3% against the dollar. Investors weighed risks from potential U.S. tariffs on EU goods and the bloc’s €800B defense spending plan.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian futures pointed lower, with Nikkei 225 contracts down 2%, tracking Wall Street’s tech-led slump. The yen’s strength pressured Japanese exporters, while Australia and Hong Kong futures declined. Markets digested Trump’s tariff delays and awaited U.S. jobs data for Fed rate clues. China’s inflation data and foreign reserves updates are due Friday. The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar strengthened on tariff relief, but concerns lingered over U.S. reciprocal tariffs starting April 2. Investors remained cautious amid global growth risks, with weak private payrolls (77K jobs added) signaling U.S. economic softening.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Chip stocks tumbled as Marvell’s weak AI outlook (-19%) sparked a sector selloff; Nvidia (-5.7%), AMD (-10%), and TSMC (-4.6%) slid. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) formed a “death cross,” down 9% YTD. Broadcom surged 10% post-market on strong AI-driven sales guidance. MongoDB plunged 27% after soft FY26 revenue forecasts, while cloud security firm Zscaler rose 3% on earnings beats. Amazon fell 3.7% amid tariff concerns, though Evercore ISI highlighted its AI potential. Insulet (+65% YoY) gained RBC’s praise for its insulin delivery tech.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    **Overview**: The cryptocurrency market faced broad declines, with 24-hour losses dominating the top 30 assets. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 7.9% to $86,819, while Ethereum (ETH) dropped 14.8% to $2,164. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI) remained stable, with USDT’s 24h volume exceeding $140B. Total market capitalization contracted significantly, led by BTC and ETH’s combined $1.98T valuation.  

**Highlight**: Cardano (ADA) and XRP saw sharp 24h drops (-18.9%, -17.0%), though ADA retained a 25.1% weekly gain. UNUS SED LEO (LEO) rose 1.3%, contrasting broader bearishness. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) showed relative resilience, down 3.4% over 24h but up 9.4% weekly.  

**Market Trend**: Bearish sentiment prevailed, with altcoins like Solana (SOL, -19.1%) and Sui (SUI, -18.0%) underperforming. Declines were widespread, though select assets (LEO, BCH) signaled pockets of strength. Stablecoin stability and elevated USDT volume suggested risk-off positioning amid volatility. Weekly performance diverged, with ADA and Aptos (APT, +6.3%) bucking longer-term downtrends.
