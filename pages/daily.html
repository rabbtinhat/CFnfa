                <div class="market-content">
                    US equities rose Monday, with the S&P 500 (+0.6%), Dow (+0.8%), and Nasdaq (+0.3%) gaining as weak retail sales (+0.2% vs. 0.6% expected) and soft manufacturing data fueled Fed rate-cut bets. Energy and Real Estate sectors led gains. Treasury yields dipped slightly (10-year at 4.299%) amid recession fears and tariff policy uncertainty. Investors await the Fed’s policy meeting (March 19-20), expecting rates to hold but anticipating dovish signals. Stocks like Tesla (-5%) and Nvidia (-13% YTD) lagged, while Luminar surged 27% on positive lidar tech reviews.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets saw limited coverage in today’s sources. However, broader global risk sentiment improved slightly as US equities rebounded. Indirect impacts include Tesla’s struggles in Europe due to Musk’s political stances and potential tariff risks from US trade policies. No major regional indices or sector-specific movements were highlighted in the provided news.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    China-focused concerns dominated: Tesla’s FSD rollout faces hurdles due to data restrictions, while Chinese EV rivals (BYD, Xiaomi) advance. Nvidia grapples with US-China export controls and tariff risks, compounded by DeepSeek’s AI model using less-powerful chips. Japan’s markets were not directly mentioned, but regional tech supply chains remain sensitive to US policy shifts. Weak US consumer data and Fed uncertainty may weigh on Asian export sentiment ahead.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Nvidia (-13% YTD) faces headwinds from China tariffs and AI competition but aims to showcase new Blackwell Ultra AI chips at GTC. Tesla (-5%) extended losses on China FSD challenges and delivery cuts (JPMorgan sees Q1 deliveries at 355k). Luminar surged 27% after a YouTube review praised its lidar over Tesla’s Autopilot. Netflix rose on upgrade citing ad-driven margins, while Intel (+7%) gained on insider buying. AMD and Arm Holdings gained attention as Nvidia rivals in AI hardware, with quantum computing developments (Google, Amazon) adding long-term uncertainty.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The cryptocurrency market exhibited bullish momentum, with most top 30 assets posting gains. Bitcoin (+1.71%) and Ethereum (+2.98%) led large-cap growth, while mid-caps like Toncoin (+35.97% 7D) and Avalanche (+13.52% 7D) showed accelerated weekly performance. Total market cap stability was maintained through steady stablecoin activity (USDT $58B volume).  

2) BNB emerged as a top performer (+4.23% 24h, +16.52% 7D), supported by $2.46B daily volume. SUI (+6.16%) and Chainlink (+5.60%) recorded above-average gains with elevated trading activity. Pi Network (-4.17%) underperformed despite broader market strength.  

3) Sector rotation favored infrastructure tokens (SOL +8.78% 7D, DOT +12.03% 7D) and meme coins (DOGE +11.38% 7D), while TON's exceptional weekly gain suggested concentrated mid-cap interest. Large caps maintained dominance (BTC 60.67% share), but altcoins showed stronger relative momentum, with XRP (+13.11% 7D) and BNB outpacing Bitcoin's 5.93% weekly gain. Rising volumes across gainers indicate sustained buying pressure.
