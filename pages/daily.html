                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equity markets whipsawed as President Trump’s tariff adjustments dominated sentiment. The S&P 500 surged 9.5% Wednesday (third-largest gain since WWII) on a 90-day pause for most reciprocal tariffs but fell 3.5% Thursday after China’s effective tariff rate was clarified at 145%. The Nasdaq tumbled 4.3% Thursday, erasing part of its 12.2% prior-day rally. Treasury yields stabilized near 4.39% after bond market volatility forced Trump’s tariff rethink. Auto stocks like Tesla (-7.3%) and Ford (-3.8%) reversed gains amid margin concerns, while banks sank on recession fears. The dollar index hit yearly lows, down 1.83% Thursday.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced pressure as the EU approved retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports (effective April 15) and digested Trump’s trade shifts. The Stoxx 600 fell 3.5% Wednesday, with autos and industrials lagging. Bond markets saw volatility, with German yields spiking 20bps before paring losses. Investors remain wary of prolonged negotiations and sector-specific tariffs (steel/aluminum at 25%). Export-heavy firms like luxury goods makers slid on China demand concerns. The euro strengthened against the dollar, aided by ECB rate-cut expectations. Commodity-linked stocks suffered as oil and copper prices sank on global growth fears.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets braced for heightened U.S.-China trade tensions after Trump raised Chinese tariffs to 145%. China’s retaliatory 84% rate on U.S. goods and restrictions on Hollywood imports intensified economic risks. Japan’s Nikkei fell as the yen surged 1.5% against the dollar. Commodity exporters (Australia, Indonesia) faced pressure from an 8% drop in the S&P GSCI index since April 2. Copper hit $8,380/ton (-16% monthly), signaling recession fears. Chinese equities underperformed amid property sector woes and manufacturing uncertainty. India’s markets stabilized as domestic firms gained from potential supply-chain shifts.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks mirrored broader volatility, with Tesla (-7.3%) and Nvidia (-5.9%) reversing Wednesday’s rally on China tariff risks. Apple fell 4.2% as analysts warned iPhone price hikes (13-21%) may be needed to offset tariffs. Semiconductor firms faced dual pressures from U.S.-China tensions and potential sector-specific levies. Netflix held technical support levels, but streaming stocks like Warner Bros. Discovery (-12.5%) plunged on China’s film import curbs. Palantir (+19% Wednesday) pared gains as trade uncertainty persisted. AI-focused firms saw mixed reactions, with investors weighing geopolitical risks against long-term growth narratives.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The crypto market faced broad declines today, with the total market cap dropping approximately 5% compared to yesterday. Bitcoin (-4.3%) and Ethereum (-9.0%) led the downturn, dragging most large-cap assets lower. Trading volumes decreased 25-50% across major coins compared to prior day levels, suggesting reduced momentum in the selloff.  

2) Notable underperformers included Toncoin (-8.2%), Uniswap (-8.0%), and Sui (-7.8%), all exceeding Bitcoin's decline. Hyperliquid (HYPE) emerged as the sole top-30 gainer (+0.8%), extending its 20.7% weekly rally. Ethereum's -9% drop significantly underperformed its -15.8% weekly decline, indicating accelerating bearish pressure.  

3) Large caps (-4% to -9%) showed stronger correlation to Bitcoin's movement than mid-caps, though sector-wide weakness prevailed. Stablecoin volumes remained elevated (USDT $83B), signaling ongoing capital preservation. The 24h losses (-4% to -9%) outpaced 7d returns (-3% to -17%) for most assets, suggesting intensified short-term bearish sentiment across market segments.
