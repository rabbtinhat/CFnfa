                <h2>North America Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. markets experienced a sharp downturn at the end of the week, with all three major indices closing in the red. The S&P 500 fell 1.7%, the Nasdaq Composite lost over 2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped approximately 750 points, marking its worst day of the year. The sell-off was driven by concerns over slowing economic growth, rising inflation expectations, and ongoing uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Walmart's warning about its 2025 outlook, citing tariff-related uncertainties, further exacerbated market jitters. Economic data also pointed to weakening consumer sentiment, with the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index dropping to 64.7 in February, well below expectations. Additionally, U.S. business activity growth nearly stalled in February, according to flash PMI data, adding to the bearish sentiment. Notable movers included UnitedHealth, which fell over 7% amid a DOJ probe into its Medicare billing practices, and Celsius Holdings, which surged over 30% after announcing a $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nutrition.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets showed resilience compared to their U.S. counterparts, with defense stocks posting their best week in 16 months. This outperformance came as European nations ramped up investments in modernizing their defense capabilities following the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In contrast, U.S. defense contractors faced headwinds due to concerns over potential cuts in military spending under the new administration. The S&P 500 Aerospace and Defense Index extended its losing streak to four weeks, while European arms makers like BAE Systems and Rheinmetall saw significant gains. The divergence in performance highlights the growing geopolitical focus in Europe and the uncertainty surrounding U.S. defense policies. Meanwhile, broader European indices remained relatively stable, supported by strong corporate earnings and optimism around economic recovery.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets ended the week on a positive note, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index surging over 3.4%, driven by a strong rally in Alibaba shares. The Chinese tech giant reported a 239% year-over-year jump in net profit for the fourth quarter, fueled by growth in its cloud and AI businesses. Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares also climbed 10% in premarket trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.2% as inflation data showed sustained price growth, with core inflation rising to 3.2% in January, above expectations. However, concerns over China’s economic slowdown and the impact of U.S. tariffs on regional trade continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Despite these challenges, Asian markets benefited from a rebound in tech stocks and optimism around corporate earnings.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    The tech sector remained in focus as companies continued to bet heavily on artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia, a key player in the AI chip market, saw its shares rise as demand for its advanced processors remained strong. The company’s CFO highlighted “staggering” demand for its Blackwell processor, with tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet investing billions in AI data centers. However, Deutsche Bank remained cautious on Nvidia, maintaining a hold rating ahead of its earnings report. Meanwhile, Block Inc. faced a steep sell-off, with shares dropping nearly 18% after missing revenue and profit estimates. The company’s Cash App growth remained flat, raising concerns about its ability to compete with rivals like PayPal. In other news, Unity Software surged over 30% after beating earnings expectations and launching a new AI-driven ad platform, signaling strong momentum in its gaming and AdTech businesses.
