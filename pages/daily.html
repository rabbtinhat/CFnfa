                <h2>North America Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. markets closed mixed ahead of Good Friday, with the S&P 500 up 0.13% and the Dow down 1.33% on tariff-related volatility. Capital One’s $35B acquisition of Discover cleared key regulatory hurdles, poised to create the largest U.S. credit card firm. Netflix surged 3.3% post-earnings on resilient subscriber metrics and upbeat guidance, contrasting broader tech declines tied to Trump’s tariff uncertainty. Apple and Nvidia faced volatility, with Apple recovering slightly on tariff exemptions, while Nvidia dropped 7% after U.S. chip export bans to China.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets saw limited activity amid U.S. tariff headlines and holiday closures. Swiss banks reported increased interest from wealthy U.S. clients diversifying portfolios due to geopolitical risks and dollar concerns. The Swiss franc’s stability and neutral politics attracted capital inflows, though regulatory compliance remains strict. No major index movements were reported, with focus on global trade tensions and potential ripple effects from U.S. tariff policies.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.03% as March inflation hit 3.6%, above the BOJ’s 2% target. South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.53%, while Chinese markets were flat. Shipping stocks in Japan and South Korea rallied after Trump imposed fees on China-built vessels. Broader Asia-Pacific trading was thin due to holidays in Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Tariff exemptions for consumer electronics briefly lifted regional tech sentiment, though semiconductor export bans and ongoing U.S.-China trade probes kept volatility elevated.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Netflix outperformed with strong Q1 earnings, emphasizing recession resilience and stable subscriber retention. Apple and Nvidia remained volatile: Apple regained ground post-tariff exemptions, while Nvidia fell on China chip restrictions. AMD ranked among top Reddit stocks, with analysts bullish on AI-driven data center growth despite tariff risks. Amazon retained analyst confidence as a long-term tech leader despite tariff headwinds. Broader tech faced pressure from Trump’s trade policies, including semiconductor probes and potential supply chain tariffs, though exemptions for electronics temporarily eased sector concerns.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The crypto market saw a slight pullback, with Bitcoin dipping 0.6% to $84,566 and Ethereum gaining 0.5% to $1,596. Total market cap declined marginally (-0.3%) as Bitcoin dominance eased to 62.9% from 63.1%, suggesting mild capital rotation. Trading volumes fell significantly (-42% BTC, -46% ETH), indicating reduced momentum.

2) Solana (-0.4% today, +10.7% weekly) cooled after strong weekly performance, while Bitcoin Cash (+1.9% today, +9.8% weekly) and Hyperliquid (+0.4% today, +8.6% weekly) maintained upward trajectories. TRON led losses (-3.2%), underperforming major coins. Shiba Inu (+4.0%) outperformed with elevated meme coin activity despite Bitcoin's decline.

3) Layer 1 protocols showed divergence - Solana's weekly momentum slowed while Bitcoin Cash extended gains. Mid-caps like Polkadot (+1.8% today, +3.6% weekly) gained traction versus large caps. Stablecoin volumes fell 30-44%, aligning with broader volume contraction. The market shows selective risk appetite favoring infrastructure projects over pure speculative assets compared to last week's broad rally.
