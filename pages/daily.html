                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equity indices closed lower amid tariff volatility and stagflation fears. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, nearing correction territory, while the Dow dropped 1.1% and the Nasdaq dipped 0.2%. Markets reacted to Trump’s tariff threats against Canada, later partially walked back, and awaited February’s CPI data (expected at 2.9% YoY). Tesla rebounded 3.8% after Musk pledged to boost U.S. production, but travel stocks like Delta sank on weak demand. Core inflation remains sticky, with Fed Chair Powell warning of persistent pressures. Concerns over policy uncertainty and slowing growth drove sector-wide declines, particularly in tech and industrials.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets fell as travel and transportation stocks slumped. The Stoxx 600 dropped 1.3%, led by airlines (Delta cut forecasts) and cruise operators. Auto stocks faced pressure amid U.S. tariff risks, though Volkswagen and Stellantis secured temporary exemptions. Germany’s DAX slid 1.7% as exports declined, while the UK’s FTSE 100 dipped 0.9% on energy sector weakness. Investors weighed stagflation risks and softer economic data, with ECB policymakers signaling caution. Travel-related sectors underperformed amid weakening consumer sentiment, while defensive utilities and healthcare saw muted losses.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian equities mirrored U.S. declines, with futures pointing to losses in Japan and Australia. The Hang Seng fell 0.7%, though mainland investors bought a record $3.8B in Hong Kong tech shares (Alibaba, Tencent). China’s CSI 300 rose 0.4% on stimulus hopes, while Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1% after weak Q4 GDP. Citi upgraded Chinese equities, citing tech strength, but Trump’s steel tariffs weighed on Australian bonds. Regional markets grappled with U.S. policy uncertainty, though Chinese tech outperformed on AI optimism. India’s IndusInd Bank plunged 27% on derivatives discrepancies, dragging financials.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks remained volatile as the “Magnificent Seven” extended losses. Tesla rebounded 3.8% post-Musk’s U.S. output pledge, but shares are down 50% from December highs amid sales concerns. Nvidia fell 0.3%, while Palantir rose 2.2% after a 38% slump. Morgan Stanley called Tesla a “buying opportunity” on AI potential. Reddit surged 14% on bullish analyst notes. Broader tech faced headwinds from tariff risks and earnings skepticism, with the Nasdaq underperforming. AI capex debates and Fed policy uncertainty pressured valuations, though long-term AI optimism persisted.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Overview: The cryptocurrency market showed mixed movements today, with major assets like Bitcoin (+4.3%) and Ethereum (+2.1%) posting moderate 24-hour gains amid stabilizing trading volumes. Stablecoins USDT and USDC remained flat, reflecting neutral sentiment.  

Highlight: Altcoins outperformed, with XRP (+6.6%), Cardano (+6.7%), Dogecoin (+6.6%), and Avalanche (+7%) leading gains. Bitcoin Cash (+7.3% weekly) defied broader weekly downtrends. Sui (+7.1%) and Aptos (+5.9%) were top movers among mid-cap tokens.  

Market Trend: Despite daily rebounds, most assets remain in negative weekly territory, including Ethereum (-11.3%), Solana (-13.5%), and Cardano (-22.2%), signaling lingering bearish pressure. High 24-hour volumes for Bitcoin ($54B) and Ethereum ($31B) suggest active accumulation, though diluted valuations for tokens like Hedera (-18.3% weekly) and Shiba Inu (-7.4% weekly) highlight sector-specific volatility. The market shows tentative recovery signs but remains cautious amid persistent weekly sell-offs.
