                <h2>North America Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. stocks ended mixed on April 1, 2025, with the S&P 500 up 0.4%, the Nasdaq rising 0.9%, and the Dow slightly down. Investors are focused on President Trump’s upcoming “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, with speculation of a 20% blanket tariff driving uncertainty. Weak economic data, including a contracting manufacturing sector and low job openings, pressured Treasury yields downward. Newsmax stock soared 180% after a 735% gain, while Tesla rose 3.6% ahead of its Q1 delivery update. Tariffs remain the trending topic, impacting market sentiment.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets were indirectly highlighted through Tesla’s sales struggles, with registrations dropping sharply in March—down 36.8% in France, 63.9% in Norway, and 65.6% in Denmark. The broader EV market grew 26.1% in the EU, UK, and EFTA, contrasting Tesla’s 42.6% decline over January-February. Trump’s tariff threats, potentially affecting pharmaceutical imports, also loom large, with Ireland’s role in drug manufacturing noted. No direct European index data was provided, but tariff uncertainty and Tesla’s woes dominate the narrative.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asia-Pacific markets showed resilience, with Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 up over 1% after steady interest rates. Japan’s Nikkei 225 hovered flat after a correction, impacted by Trump’s 25% auto tariff threat, hitting Japanese carmakers like Toyota hard. China’s military drills near Taiwan added geopolitical tension, while Tesla’s China shipments fell 49% in February despite an 82% rise in new energy vehicle sales. Trump’s tariff plans remain a trending concern, influencing trade-sensitive Asian markets.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tesla faced scrutiny with a 36% stock drop in Q1 2025 and declining sales across Europe, China, and the U.S., despite a 3.6% rise on Tuesday. Elon Musk linked the slump to his political stances. OpenAI secured a record $40 billion funding round, valuing it at $300 billion. Apple saw mixed Wall Street views, with Citigroup bullish and UBS cautious amid AI delays and weak iPhone sales. Trump’s tariffs trend as a key external factor affecting tech giants’ supply chains and costs.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) Market-wide performance: The crypto market rebounded today, with Bitcoin (+3.1%) and Ethereum (+4.8%) leading gains. Total top 30 market cap increased ~3.5%, reversing some weekly losses (-2.9% BTC, -7.3% ETH 7d). Stablecoins maintained peg stability.

2) Key movers: Sui (+7.5%) and Dogecoin (+4.3%) outperformed with above-average volume spikes. Chainlink (+4.5%) and Avalanche (+4.3%) showed strong recovery momentum. Toncoin (-1.5%) and Hyperliquid (-16.9% 7d) underperformed despite recent gains.

3) Dominant trends: Large caps led the recovery while mid-caps lagged (Solana -12.1% 7d vs +0.4% today). Sector rotation appears toward infrastructure coins (LINK, AVAX) with developer activity. Ethereum's 24h surge (+4.8%) contrasts with persistent weekly outflows (-7.3%), suggesting potential short-covering. Trading volumes declined 15% in top assets except Sui (+11% volume) and USDe stablecoin (+14% volume), indicating selective capital deployment.
