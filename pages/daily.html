                    U.S. stocks closed mixed amid tariff uncertainty and inflation data. The S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, while the Nasdaq fell 0.3%, extending weekly losses driven by tech weakness (notably Nvidia’s 8% drop post-earnings). The Dow edged down slightly. January’s core PCE met expectations at 2.6% annually, but consumer spending declined 0.2%, raising growth concerns. Trump’s planned 10% tariffs on China (effective March 4) and levies on Mexico/Canada fueled market anxiety. Bitcoin plunged 7% to November lows. Consumer Staples outperformed, with Vital Farms rising 5% on egg-supply optimism. Copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan gained on potential U.S. tariff-driven price premiums.

Copper-related firms (e.g., Antofagasta) fell as U.S. tariffs risked export disruptions. Auto and industrial sectors weakened on Trump’s EU tariff threats. The euro dipped 0.2% post-U.S.-Ukraine tensions. UK markets lagged as GBP softened. Analysts flagged risks of prolonged COMEX-LME copper arbitrage gaps, pressuring European manufacturers.

Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1.2% as tech mirrored Nasdaq’s slide and a weaker yen heightened import-cost fears. South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.5% on semiconductor sector woes. India’s Nifty 50 bucked the trend, rising 0.8% on domestic growth optimism. Bitcoin’s 12% weekly crash dragged crypto-linked Asian stocks (SBI Holdings, Wemade).

Palantir dropped 32% from February highs amid CEO share sales and defense-spending cuts. Apple rose 1% after NHL/MLB sports-tech deals. Super Micro plunged 26% weekly on accounting worries despite filing delayed SEC reports. Dell slid 7% on revenue miss, while Autodesk fell 3% post-layoffs. SoundHound AI surged 15% on raised revenue guidance. AI optimism clashed with tariff risks, with Morgan Stanley warning of valuation compression in high-growth tech amid macro uncertainty.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    **Overview:**  
The crypto market exhibited mixed signals, with most major assets consolidating after recent declines. Bitcoin (-0.39%) and Ethereum (-2.94%) saw modest 24-hour losses, while stablecoins (USDT, USDC) held steady. Total market activity remained elevated, led by Bitcoin’s $85.9B 24-hour volume.  

**Highlights:**  
Solana (+7.0%), Hedera (+6.76%), and Bitcoin Cash (+6.7%) outperformed, bucking broader bearishness. Conversely, Polkadot (-4.69%) and Hyperliquid (-4.38%) faced notable sell-offs. Aptos (+4.96%) and Monero (+4.32%) also posted gains, reflecting selective risk appetite.  

**Market Trend:**  
Short-term sentiment remains cautious, with most top-30 assets down 7–17% weekly. Volatility persists, highlighted by divergences between laggards (e.g., ADA: -17.1% weekly) and resilience in niche sectors (DeFi, privacy tokens). Stablecoin dominance rose slightly, suggesting capital preservation amid uncertainty. The market continues to seek equilibrium after recent corrections, with technical rebounds in select altcoins failing to offset broader pressure.
