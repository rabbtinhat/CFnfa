                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equity indices declined Tuesday, with the S&P 500 down 1.1% and Nasdaq dropping 1.7% amid tech sector weakness. Investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, expecting rates to hold steady but focused on updated economic projections and tariff-related risks. The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks underperformed, dragging indexes lower, while Tesla fell 5% due to Chinese EV competition. Bank of America’s survey highlighted a historic drop in bullish sentiment, citing tariff fears and growth concerns. Treasury yields edged lower, with the 10-year at 4.287% as markets priced in potential rate cuts later this year.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Germany’s Bundestag passed a historic debt reform, suspending fiscal constraints to boost defense spending and a €500B climate fund. The DAX rose 0.3% on the news, though broader European markets were mixed amid U.S. tariff uncertainty. The OECD cut its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 2.2%, citing trade risks. Auto stocks gained as Zeekr announced free autonomous driving software in China, while energy firms rallied on Trump’s coal production push. The Stoxx 600 rose 0.8%, supported by industrials, though defensive sectors lagged as investors awaited Fed guidance and tariff clarity.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets faced pressure from U.S. tech declines and tariff concerns, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 1.2%. Chinese EV makers BYD and Xiaomi surged on battery tech updates and production hikes, contrasting with Tesla’s 53% drop from December highs. Japan’s Nikkei slid 0.7% as exporters weighed yen volatility. XPeng rose 4% after strong Q1 guidance, while South Korean chip stocks mirrored Nvidia’s 3% drop. Investors monitored U.S.-China trade tensions, particularly potential retaliatory measures against Trump’s tariffs, which could further disrupt regional supply chains and export-dependent economies.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks led declines as the “Magnificent Seven” posted their worst quarter since 2022. Nvidia fell 3% despite unveiling new AI chips at its GTC event, while Alphabet dropped 2.7% after acquiring cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32B. Tesla slid 5% amid BYD’s 1,000kW charging tech launch and Xiaomi’s expanded EV production. Meta turned negative YTD, and Apple lost 18% from December highs. AI-related concerns persisted, with Goldman Sachs noting tech’s “structural growth” remains intact but warning of near-term volatility. Semiconductor stocks like Super Micro Computer plunged 9.6% on growth fears.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) **Market-wide performance**: The crypto market saw broad declines, with Bitcoin (-2.56%) and Ethereum (-1.71%) leading losses among large caps. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI) held parity, reflecting risk-off sentiment. Total trading volume remained elevated at $238B+ for BTC and $96B+ for ETH, suggesting heightened activity despite price drops.  

2) **Key movers**: TRON (+6.71%) and Bitget Token (+4.01%) outperformed, with TRX volume up 255% vs. its 7d average. Toncoin extended its weekly rally (+33.06%) despite modest 24h gains (+2.17%). Dogecoin (-4.90%), Shiba Inu (-4.90%), and Litecoin (-5.27%) underperformed sharply. Pi Network collapsed (-16.53%) on high volume, accelerating its 7d decline (-20.68%).  

3) **Dominant trends**: Mid-caps showed divergence: BNB (+13.08% weekly) and MANTRA (+10.05%) resisted bearish pressure, while ADA (-5.01% weekly) lagged. Sector rotation appeared toward protocols with strong utility narratives (TON’s ecosystem growth, BNB’s chain activity). Large-cap dominance dipped slightly (BTC: 60.52%, ETH: 8.57%) as traders rebalanced into select mid-caps. Bearish momentum dominated short-term action, though Toncoin’s sustained rally and stablecoin inflows hinted at selective accumulation.
