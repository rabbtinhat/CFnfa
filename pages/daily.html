                <div class="market-content">
                    North American equities faced significant pressure, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posting their worst weekly performances since September, down over 3% and 3.6%, respectively.

Investors await February CPI and PPI reports for clues on price trends. Analysts highlighted market volatility as a potential buying opportunity, particularly in tech and financials, though caution persists amid Fed rate-cut delays. Treasury yields stabilized, while sectors like energy and defensives saw relative resilience.
