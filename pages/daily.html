                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. stocks rallied after the Fed held rates steady, signaling two cuts in 2025 and downplaying tariff-driven inflation risks as "transitory." The Nasdaq (+1.4%), S&P 500 (+1.1%), and Dow (+0.9%) rose, led by tech rebounds (Nvidia +1.8%, Tesla +4.5%). Bond yields fell as traders priced in dovish Fed expectations. Stagflation fears eased despite revised growth/inflation forecasts. Boeing surged 6.3% on improved cash flow guidance, while insurers outperformed amid defensive rotation. Markets remain sensitive to tariff uncertainty, but Powell’s reassurance on economic resilience bolstered sentiment.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced pressure as Turkey’s BIST 100 dropped 7% intraday after Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu’s arrest sparked political turmoil, dragging the lira to record lows. The Stoxx 600 pared losses but remained cautious amid U.S. tariff risks and EU growth concerns. Germany’s DAX (+0.98%) rose after passing fiscal reforms to boost defense spending. Investors monitored ECB policy signals as bond yields mirrored U.S. declines. European insurers and defensive sectors gained, while banks underperformed due to recession fears.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets were mixed: Japan’s Nikkei (-0.2%) dipped post-BoJ’s steady rates, while China’s Hang Seng Tech (+30% YTD) extended gains on AI optimism (DeepSeek R1 model). The MSCI China Index (+19% YTD) outperformed amid cheap valuations and policy support. China unveiled childcare subsidies to spur consumption. South Korea’s KOSPI (+0.7%) rose on tech strength. India’s markets stabilized after recent volatility. Regional focus remains on U.S. tariff impacts and China’s economic recovery, with analysts predicting continued divergence from Wall Street.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Nvidia slid 3.4% post-GTC conference despite unveiling Blackwell Ultra/Vera Rubin AI chips and a $1 trillion data center capex forecast. Partners (Coherent +7%, Supermicro +6%) rallied on JPMorgan’s supply-chain optimism. Tesla rebounded 4.5% after Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded it, citing Robotaxi potential. Google announced a $32B acquisition of cybersecurity firm Wiz. Intel fell 5% amid sector rotation. AI-driven gains in Lumentum (+4%) and Fabrinet (+3%) contrasted with broader tech volatility, as markets weighed tariff risks against innovation catalysts.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) **Market-wide performance**: The cryptocurrency market exhibits bullish momentum, with Bitcoin (+4.3%) and Ethereum (+6.7%) leading gains. Total market cap dominance remains concentrated in BTC (60.5%) and ETH (8.76%). Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) show minimal price volatility, while altcoins like XRP (+11%), Solana (+7.3%), and Cardano (+5.9%) outperform BTC’s 24h rise.  

2) **Key movers**: XRP surged 11% (24h) with $9.2B volume, outpacing its 13% weekly gain. Chainlink (+8.6%) and Hyperliquid (+10.1%) led mid-caps, while Toncoin (+34% 7d) maintained strong mid-term momentum. BNB (-1.9%) and TRON (-2.1%) were rare decliners. Trading volumes spiked for Bitcoin ($32.5B) and Ethereum ($19.8B), signaling heightened activity.  

3) **Dominant trends**: Sector rotation favors Layer 1s (Solana, Avalanche +5.1%) and DeFi tokens (Uniswap +10%). Mid-caps outperformed large-caps in 24h gains, with smaller projects like Hyperliquid (+17.7% 7d) showing aggressive momentum. Bitcoin’s 4.3% daily gain lags ETH’s 6.7%, suggesting altcoin strength. Sustained 7d gains across majors (BTC +3.1%, ETH +7.7%) indicate bullish sentiment reinforced by rising volumes.
