                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities faced sharp declines as Trump’s 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China took effect, sparking global trade war fears. The S&P 500 erased post-election gains, down ~2% YTD, while the Nasdaq flirted with correction territory. Small caps (Russell 2000) and sectors like Energy and Industrials lagged, reversing initial post-election optimism. Financials (+7% since Nov.) outperformed. Treasury yields sank to 4.2% amid growth concerns, while the dollar retreated. Retailers Target and Best Buy warned of tariff-driven profit pressures. Bitcoin fell ~22% from January highs, erasing gains tied to Trump’s crypto reserve plans.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets outperformed U.S. peers in February, with the Stoxx 600 gaining 3.3% amid defense sector rallies. Thales, Hensoldt, and Saab surged on EU’s proposed €800B “ReArm Europe Plan,” though analysts cautioned gains depend on long-term policy execution. Auto and industrial stocks faced pressure from U.S. tariff risks. The ECB’s expected rate cuts and resilient earnings supported sentiment, but trade war spillover risks lingered. Germany’s DAX rose 3.8%, while the UK’s FTSE 100 gained 1.6%. Defense stocks remained focal amid geopolitical tensions and Trump’s calls for higher NATO spending.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Asia-Pacific markets fell as U.S. tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures (15% on farm goods) dampened sentiment. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.2%, with chip stocks like Advantest declining. South Korea’s Kospi dipped 0.15% amid tech weakness. TSMC announced a $100B U.S. expansion, aligning with Trump’s chip reshoring push. Singapore detained individuals for rerouting Nvidia chips to China, amplifying export-control concerns. India and ASEAN markets saw mixed trade. China’s manufacturing PMI contraction and property sector woes added pressure, though ByteDance’s $315B valuation highlighted pockets of tech resilience despite TikTok’s U.S. ban risks.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Nvidia rebounded 1.7% intraday after an 8% drop tied to tariff and chip-diversion probes but remains down 15% YTD. TikTok parent ByteDance launched a $315B-valued buyback amid U.S. divestment pressures. Flutter surged 3% post-earnings on strong U.S. betting trends. AI stocks like Super Micro and Palantir rallied despite macro concerns. Google lobbied against DOJ breakup efforts, citing national security risks. Okta jumped 24% on earnings beats, while GitLab rose 12% despite soft guidance. DeepSeek’s low-cost AI model continued to pressure sector valuations, though Wedbush argued it may spur broader GPU demand.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    **Overview:** The cryptocurrency market exhibited mixed movements, with moderate gains among major assets offsetting broader weekly declines. Bitcoin (+1.39%) and Ethereum (+2.80%) led modest recoveries, while stablecoins (USDT, USDC) held steady near their pegs.  

**Highlights:** Hedera (HBAR) surged 9.35%, outpacing peers with a 17.77% weekly rise. XRP (+5.29%) and Stellar (XLM, +5.30%) posted notable 24-hour gains. Litecoin (-3.54%) and Hyperliquid (HYPE, -2.90%) underperformed, reflecting sector-specific volatility.  

**Market Trend:** Short-term upward momentum contrasts with significant weekly losses (Bitcoin: -10.63%, Ethereum: -21.34%), signaling lingering bearish sentiment. Mid-cap assets like Monero (+4.03%) and NEAR Protocol (+4.21%) saw intraday strength, though most remain down over seven days. Trading volumes stabilized, with stablecoin dominance underscoring cautious capital allocation amid broader uncertainty.
