                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities rebounded sharply after President Trump delayed auto tariffs on Canada and Mexico by one month, easing trade war fears. The S&P 500 (+1.1%), Dow (+1.1%), and Nasdaq (+1.4%) surged, led by automakers Ford (+5.8%), GM (+7.2%), and Stellantis (+9.2%). Weak ADP jobs data (77K vs. expected 150K) initially pressured markets, but tariff relief overshadowed concerns. Industrials and materials sectors outperformed amid a weaker dollar. Disney cut 200 jobs in its ABC News division, while Mars Inc. issued a record $26B bond to fund its Kellanova acquisition. Defense stocks like Huntington Ingalls (+12.3%) rallied on Trump’s shipbuilding focus.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets rallied as Germany announced plans to boost defense and infrastructure spending, fueling a 1.5% euro surge to $1.0789 (3-day high). The Stoxx 600 rose, led by industrials and automotive stocks recovering from tariff-driven losses. BlackRock’s $22.8B Panama Canal port deal aligned with Trump’s trade agenda, lifting infrastructure-linked equities. However, auto tariffs and retaliatory risks lingered, with EU leaders monitoring U.S. policy shifts. The euro’s rally sparked bullish options bets targeting $1.20, though analysts debated sustainability. UK’s FTSE underperformed amid sterling strength and energy sector drags from falling oil prices.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets were mixed: China’s CSI 300 (+0.4%) rose on Beijing’s 5% GDP target and tech support vows, while Japan’s Nikkei (-0.8%) dipped on yen strength. South Korean K-pop stocks (HYBE, JYP) outperformed, immune to U.S. tariff risks. Emerging markets gained as the dollar weakened, with MSCI’s EM index up 2.1%. India’s Sensex edged higher on domestic growth optimism, though Taiwan and Hong Kong traded cautiously amid tech supply chain concerns. Australia’s ASX 200 (-0.8%) fell despite Q4 GDP beat, weighed by mining stocks on tariff-linked demand fears.

                    Tech stocks rebounded with Nasdaq (+1.5%), though CrowdStrike (-6.3%) sank on weak guidance. Moderna (+15.9%) surged on CEO stock buys and cancer vaccine updates. Cybersecurity firms like Zscaler (+4%) rose post-earnings, while MongoDB (-18%) plunged on soft outlook. AI-linked chip stocks (Nvidia +2%) recovered partially from tariff-driven losses. Elon Musk’s DOGE workforce cuts threatened D.C.-area restaurants (Cava, Sweetgreen). Disney’s streaming unit avoided layoffs, but tech consolidation continued. AppLovin (+2%) gained on gaming unit sale talks, while Arista Networks (+34% target) was upgraded by UBS on cloud demand.

                <div class="market-content">
                    **Overview:** The crypto market showed mixed momentum, with significant 24-hour gains in major assets offsetting broader weekly declines. Bitcoin (+8.95%) and Ethereum (+7.47%) led large-cap rallies, while stablecoins (USDT, USDC) remained flat. Total market activity surged, evidenced by Bitcoin’s $75B 24-hour volume.  

**Highlight:** XRP (+19.33%) and Cardano (+52.87%) outperformed, with Cardano’s price surpassing $1. Solana (+16.73%) and Chainlink (+14.37%) also posted double-digit gains, reflecting renewed altcoin interest.  

**Market Trend:** Short-term bullish signals dominated, though weekly performance varied. Bitcoin (-2.35%) and Ethereum (-11.30%) remained in negative 7-day territory, contrasting with XRP (+8.42%) and Cardano (+36.67%). Mid-caps like Polkadot (+8.14%) and Avalanche (+8.92%) mirrored the recovery, while MANTRA (-12.81%) and Hyperliquid (-7.79%) lagged. Volatility persists, with select altcoins driving momentum amid fluctuating sentiment.
