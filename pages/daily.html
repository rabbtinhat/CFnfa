                    US stocks showed mixed performance as investors weighed concerns over President Trump's tariff policies and awaited Nvidia's earnings report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) remained flat, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Nvidia (NVDA), a key player in the AI chip market, saw its shares drop 3% ahead of its earnings release, which is expected to provide insights into how the company is navigating tariff risks and competition from China-based DeepSeek. Apple (AAPL) gained slightly after announcing a $500 billion investment plan in the US, while Microsoft (MSFT) declined following reports of reduced data center construction. The market remains cautious as investors await key economic data, including the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets were buoyed by political developments in Germany, where mainstream conservative parties secured a victory in Sunday's elections, easing concerns over far-right gains. The German DAX index rose nearly 1%, reflecting optimism about economic stability. However, broader European markets were mixed, with France's CAC 40 slipping 0.5%. Investors remain wary of the potential impact of US tariff policies on global trade, particularly as President Trump reiterated plans to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada. The focus in Europe is also on the Federal Reserve's upcoming inflation data, which could influence global market sentiment. Meanwhile, European defense stocks saw gains amid expectations of increased military spending under the new German government.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets faced downward pressure as investors reacted to weak US economic data and concerns over US-China trade tensions. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index fell, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropping 0.6% and Japan's market closed for a holiday. Chinese stocks, however, showed resilience, driven by optimism around the country's AI sector, particularly after DeepSeek's advancements in AI technology. The CSI 300 Index slipped 0.2%, but Chinese tech stocks, including Alibaba (BABA), remained in focus as they continue to compete with US AI giants. Investors are closely monitoring the potential impact of US tariffs on Chinese imports, which could further strain trade relations between the two economies.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks were in the spotlight as Nvidia (NVDA) prepared to report its quarterly earnings, with analysts closely watching its performance in the AI chip market. Nvidia faces challenges from China-based DeepSeek, which has developed cost-effective AI models that could disrupt demand for high-end chips. Microsoft (MSFT) shares declined after reports of reduced data center construction, raising questions about the company's AI infrastructure investments. Apple (AAPL) gained after announcing a $500 billion US investment plan, signaling efforts to mitigate tariff risks. Meanwhile, Alibaba (BABA) saw volatility, with shares dropping 9% despite strong earnings, as investors weighed the competitive threat from DeepSeek and broader geopolitical risks. The tech sector remains a key driver of market sentiment, with AI-related developments continuing to shape investor expectations.
