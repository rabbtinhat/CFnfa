                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equity markets whipsawed amid tariff uncertainty, with the S&P 500 closing at its lowest level since April 2024 (-1.6%), while the Dow and Nasdaq fell 0.8% and 2.1%, respectively. Volatility spiked as President Trump confirmed 104% tariffs on Chinese goods effective Wednesday, reversing early gains. Financials faced pressure as banks paused IPOs, M&A, and bond deals due to recession fears. Apple sank 5% on tariff risks to its China-dependent supply chain. Treasury yields rose sharply, with the 10-year hitting 4.25%, reflecting flight-to-safety moves. Analysts warn markets remain hostage to tariff negotiations and growth concerns.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European defense stocks outperformed (Rheinmetall, ThyssenKrupp) as nations boosted military spending amid reduced U.S. alliance trust. Auto stocks gained after Volkswagen reported Q1 EV deliveries doubled YoY in Europe. However, broader markets remained cautious due to U.S. tariff spillover risks, particularly for exporters. The EU plans €800B defense spending, while Germany’s debt reform enables defense expansion. Mergers and bond issuance slowed, mirroring Wall Street’s freeze. Stalled IPOs (eToro, Klarna) and tariff-driven inflation fears weighed on sentiment, though ECB rate-cut hopes provided limited support.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets faced dual pressures from U.S. tariffs and anti-American consumer sentiment. Chinese equities lagged as Beijing vowed retaliation, while South Korean defense firms (Hanwha Aerospace, KAI) rose on European orders. Japan’s defense stocks gained on plans to hike military spending to 2% of GDP. Fast-food chains (McDonald’s, Starbucks) saw growth risks in China amid boycotts. Export-heavy economies (Vietnam, Taiwan) braced for higher U.S. duties, though India and Cambodia emerged as potential tariff negotiation candidates. Bond markets tightened, with corporate refinancing hurdles for junk-rated firms. Regional central banks signaled readiness to stabilize currencies.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks sold off sharply, led by Apple (-5%) on China tariff risks and production cost concerns. Tesla fell 22% over four sessions amid Musk-Navarro tensions and tariff-driven supply chain pressures. Semiconductor stocks (Nvidia, Broadcom) reversed gains despite buyback announcements, with Marvell slipping 1.9% post-divestiture. Anti-U.S. sentiment threatened tech firms reliant on Asian markets, while EU tariff exemptions boosted Volkswagen’s EV outlook. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks and AI leader Nvidia faced valuation resets amid macro uncertainty. Analysts highlighted diverging winners (defense tech) vs. losers (consumer hardware) in the tariff regime.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) Market-wide performance: The crypto market faced broad declines, with Bitcoin (-3.6%) and Ethereum (-7.0%) leading losses. Total market cap decreased ~3.5% from yesterday, extending weekly losses to -10% for BTC and -23% for ETH. Trading volumes fell sharply, with BTC's 24h volume dropping 50% and ETH's volume declining 58% from prior day.  

2) Key movers: TRON (+1.06%) bucked the trend with moderate gains. Major underperformers included Uniswap (-8.1%), Shiba Inu (-7.5%), and Chainlink (-5.9%). MANTRA (OM) showed relative resilience (-1.7%) compared to other mid-caps. Stablecoins maintained peg stability with minimal price fluctuations (<0.02% change).  

3) Dominant trends: Altcoins demonstrated amplified volatility versus blue chips, with Solana (-16.6% weekly) and Avalanche (-18.3% weekly) underperforming BTC's -10.1% 7d decline. Market dominance shifted slightly to BTC (+0.04% dominance) despite its price drop, suggesting relative risk aversion. The sector-wide volume contraction (-35% average across top 30) alongside price declines indicates bearish momentum acceleration, contrasting with more gradual weekly declines.
