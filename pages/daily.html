                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. markets closed mixed ahead of Good Friday, with the Dow dropping 1.3% (led by UnitedHealth’s 22% plunge on weak guidance), while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1%. Netflix surged 9% post-earnings on revenue and subscriber growth optimism. Tech stocks faced pressure: Nvidia fell 3% after U.S. chip export bans to China, while AMD and Intel declined. Trade tensions persisted as Trump criticized Fed Chair Powell’s tariff warnings, sparking volatility. UnitedHealth’s $120B market cap loss dragged healthcare stocks lower. Investors weighed strong corporate earnings (e.g., Eli Lilly +14%) against macroeconomic risks from tariffs and Fed policy uncertainty.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets were closed for Good Friday, but pre-holiday trading reflected caution amid U.S. trade policy risks. Earlier in the week, concerns over Trump’s tariffs and Fed Chair Powell’s warnings about inflation and growth headwinds weighed on sentiment. Netflix’s price hike in France highlighted regional pricing adjustments. Banks and exporters remained sensitive to tariff-related volatility, while energy stocks benefited from rising oil prices. Investors await Monday’s reopening, with attention on global trade developments and earnings from European firms.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets faced pressure from U.S. tech export restrictions, with TSMC shares fluctuating despite strong earnings (+3% pre-Good Friday). Nvidia’s China-related revenue risks ($10B-$15B estimated loss) amplified sector concerns. Japan and South Korea’s tech-heavy indices underperformed, while Chinese equities stabilized amid tariff uncertainty. TSMC maintained its 2025 revenue outlook but flagged risks from U.S. trade policies. Regional markets will reopen Monday, with focus on U.S.-China trade talks, chip-sector developments, and broader risk sentiment driven by Trump’s tariff threats and Fed policy signals.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Netflix rose 9% after beating Q1 earnings, guiding higher Q2 revenue, and emphasizing ad-tier growth. Nvidia fell 3% as U.S. export bans to China threatened $10B+ in annual sales; AMD and Intel dipped. TSMC gained 3% pre-holiday despite tariff risks, citing robust AI demand. Alphabet slid 1.4% after a U.S. court ruled it monopolized ad tech. Eli Lilly surged 14% on positive weight-loss pill trial results. Tech sector volatility persisted amid Trump’s tariff threats, Fed policy concerns, and mixed earnings, with investors balancing AI optimism against trade-related headwinds.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) Market-wide performance: The total market cap of the top 30 cryptocurrencies increased marginally (+0.5%), led by Bitcoin (+0.5% daily, +6.8% weekly) maintaining 63.2% dominance. Ethereum dipped slightly (-0.5%) but retained weekly gains (+4.4%). Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) showed minimal volatility.  

2) Key movers: Bitcoin Cash surged +4.6% (15.9% weekly), Hyperliquid (HYPE) +5.4%, and Hedera (HBAR) +3.5% led gains with above-average volume. Solana continued momentum (+1.4% daily, +20.2% weekly). LEO (-3.5%), OKB (-1.9%), and XRP (-1.7%) underperformed. Trading volumes declined 15-25% for major assets vs prior day.  

3) Dominant trends: Mid-caps outperformed large caps, with Solana and Bitcoin Cash showing strongest weekly momentum. Sector rotation appears toward Layer 1 protocols (SOL, AVAX +5.1% weekly) and scaling solutions. Market cap growth (+$9B) despite lower volume suggests cautious accumulation, with 7-day trends (+5-20% for SOL, BCH, DOT) outpacing 24h moves, indicating sustained mid-term bullishness.
