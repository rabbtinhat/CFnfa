                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. stocks rebounded sharply Friday, with the S&P 500 (+2.1%), Nasdaq (+2.6%), and Dow (+1.6%) recovering from a volatile week driven by tariff uncertainty and government shutdown risks. Despite Friday’s rally, all indices posted weekly losses exceeding 2%, marking the S&P 500’s fastest correction since 2023. Consumer sentiment tumbled to a 15-month low (57.9), with inflation expectations spiking. Tesla rose 4% but faced bearish analyst targets, while Ulta Beauty surged 13% on strong earnings. Oil prices stabilized (WTI above $67) as traders weighed tariff risks and Ukraine ceasefire talks.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced pressure as Trump’s proposed 200% tariffs on EU spirits hit luxury stocks (Pernod Ricard, Rémy Cointreau). The Stoxx 600 dipped 0.15%, while German 10-year yields surged on defense spending plans. Telecom consolidation dominated headlines, with Deutsche Telekom and Orange urging regulators to ease merger rules to compete globally. Gold briefly topped $3,000/ounce as tariff risks boosted haven demand. EU auto and agriculture sectors braced for retaliatory tariffs amid escalating trade tensions. The ECB’s growth concerns lingered as inflation expectations rose, though core producer prices softened.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asia-Pacific markets were mixed: China’s CSI 300 rose 2% on stimulus hopes, while Japan’s exporters lagged on tariff risks. Australia’s mining stocks gained as gold hit records. India’s Sensex remained volatile amid U.S. tariff exemptions uncertainty, with Apple’s local manufacturing plans under scrutiny. South Korean tech stocks rebounded modestly, though chipmakers faced headwinds from slower global demand. Regional currencies weakened against the dollar, with investors cautious ahead of key U.S. retail sales and Fed meeting data. China’s property sector stabilized, but consumer spending concerns persisted amid weak global trade sentiment.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech led Friday’s rebound: Palantir surged 8% on defense AI partnerships, while Nvidia (+5%) and Super Micro (+8%) fueled Nasdaq’s rally. Tesla rose 4% despite Wells Fargo and JPMorgan slashing targets ($120-$130), citing tariff risks and Musk’s political backlash. AI stocks (Vistra, Constellation Energy) recovered partially after steep corrections. Ulta Beauty (+13%) and DocuSign (+18%) outperformed on earnings, though chipmakers faced macro headwinds. Meta’s legal clash with a whistleblower drew scrutiny. Semiconductor supply chains remained in focus as Trump’s tariff threats pressured hardware manufacturers reliant on global trade.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Market-wide performance: The cryptocurrency market shows mixed signals with Bitcoin (+4.29% 24h, -2.32% 7d) and Ethereum (+3.66% 24h, -9.86% 7d) leading short-term gains, offsetting broader weekly declines. Total market cap remains stable, supported by Bitcoin’s dominance (60.96%) and stablecoins (USDT, USDC) reflecting steady liquidity. 
Key movers: Solana (+10.39%), Sui (+9.45%), and Hyperliquid (+11.86%) surged on high volumes (>$300M each), while Pi (-9.44%) and TRON (-0.65%) lagged. Shiba Inu (+7.25%) and Polkadot (+7.48%) outperformed mid-caps. Stablecoins saw muted price action but dominated 24h volume ($61B for USDT). 
Dominant trends: Short-term recovery contrasts with persistent weekly losses, signaling cautious optimism. Large-caps rebounded modestly, while select mid-caps (SOL, SUI) led volatility. Stablecoin inflows and Bitcoin’s dominance suggest risk-off sentiment easing but not fully reversing. Sector-wise, Layer 1s (Solana, Avalanche) and DeFi tokens (LINK, UNI) showed divergence, with recovery in trading activity outpacing broader market momentum.
