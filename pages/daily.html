                <h2>North America Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities closed mixed amid heightened volatility, with the S&P 500 recovering losses (+0.6%) while the Nasdaq (-0.1%) and Dow (+1%) diverged. Markets faced their worst quarterly performance since 2022, driven by Trump’s escalating tariff threats targeting "all countries" effective April 2. Energy stocks surged as oil prices erased 2025 losses (WTI +3%, Brent +2%) on supply concerns. CVS Health (+50% YTD) led gains, while Tesla (-35%) and crypto-linked stocks (Coinbase -31%) underperformed. Consumer staples (Walmart, Costco) attracted defensive inflows amid recession fears, with hedge funds selling tech at the fastest pace in six months.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets saw muted trading with sector-specific moves. Aston Martin surged 13% after securing funding from Chairman Lawrence Stroll, though broader auto stocks faced pressure from U.S. tariff risks. The Stoxx Europe 600 remained range-bound as investors weighed potential retaliatory EU measures against U.S. tariffs. Luxury and export-heavy sectors (e.g., German automakers) lagged on trade-war anxieties, while defensive sectors like utilities held steady. The FTSE 100 underperformed due to energy volatility and GBP strength.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets were mixed, with China’s Shanghai Composite dragged by tech and EV weakness (Tesla sales -50% YoY in China). Japan’s Nikkei edged higher on yen depreciation, though automakers (Toyota, Honda) dipped on U.S. tariff risks. Indian indices outperformed on domestic growth optimism. Regional sentiment remained cautious ahead of U.S. tariff details, with semiconductor and export-reliant stocks (Samsung, TSMC) volatile. Bitcoin’s decline (-10% Q1) pressured crypto-linked equities in South Korea and Japan.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    The "Magnificent Seven" tech giants (Apple, Nvidia, Tesla) fell sharply, with Roundhill’s ETF down 15% YTD. Tesla (-35%) faced slowing sales, Musk’s political backlash, and tariff risks. Nvidia (-20%) neared bear-market territory amid AI investment doubts. Crypto stocks (Coinbase, Galaxy Digital) plunged as Bitcoin slumped. Palantir and AI-related firms weakened on Chinese competition (DeepSeek’s efficient models). Defensive rotations hit growth stocks, while semiconductor firms (KLA Corp) gained upgrades on process-control demand. Tech volatility dominated sector performance amid macro uncertainty.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The crypto market showed mild recovery today after recent declines, with Bitcoin (+0.61%) and Ethereum (+1.28%) posting modest 24h gains, though both remain down 6.2% and 12.4% weekly respectively. Total market cap dipped slightly as stablecoins (USDT/USDC) held firm, suggesting cautious capital preservation. Bitcoin's dominance rose to 61.4% (+0.3%), indicating relative strength versus altcoins.

2) Toncoin (+4.98%) and TRX (+3.27%) led gainers with above-average volume, while HBAR (-3.04%) and SUI (-3.02%) underperformed. Hyperliquid (+5.07%) rebounded despite 26% weekly loss, showing speculative interest. Litecoin (-3.02%) and XRP (-1.83%) extended weekly declines of 12.4% and 14.9% respectively, signaling sustained selling pressure.

3) Large-caps showed stability (BTC/ETH 24h green) while mid-caps diverged - TRX (+4.77% weekly) and TON (+11% weekly) outperformed versus sector-wide altcoin weakness. The 24h rebound failed to erase weekly losses for most assets, suggesting bearish momentum persists. Trading volumes declined 11-15% for major coins, indicating reduced conviction in price moves.
