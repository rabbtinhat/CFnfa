                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. stocks rallied after the Fed held rates steady, signaling two potential cuts in 2025 and downplaying tariff-driven inflation risks as "transitory." The Nasdaq (+1.4%), S&P 500 (+1.1%), and Dow (+0.9%) rose, led by tech rebounds (Nvidia +1.8%, Tesla +4.5%). Bond yields fell as traders priced in dovish Fed easing, with the 10-year yield dropping to 4.25%. Recession fears eased slightly, though stagflation concerns lingered. Bank of America noted a record drop in U.S. equity allocations amid tariff uncertainty, but markets stabilized post-Fed.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced volatility as Turkey’s lira hit record lows (USD/TRY 40.96) and the BIST 100 fell 7% after Istanbul Mayor Imamoglu’s arrest sparked political risks. The Stoxx 600 (+0.6%) and DAX (+1%) gained on Fed optimism, offsetting Turkey’s turmoil. Investors monitored EU growth risks linked to U.S. tariffs and potential spillover from Turkey’s instability. Germany’s fiscal package approval supported sentiment, but emerging-market equities remained pressured by Ankara’s crackdown and trade policy uncertainties.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets diverged: China’s Hang Seng Tech (+30% YTD) and MSCI China (+19% YTD) outperformed on AI optimism (DeepSeek’s R1 model) and policy stimulus. Japan’s Nikkei (-0.2%) wavered as the BOJ held rates but warned of tariff risks. Analysts flagged China’s valuations (13.38x P/E) as attractive vs. U.S. (20.72x), driving rotation from tech-heavy U.S. indices. The BOJ’s growth downgrade and China’s child-care subsidy plans aimed to counter weak consumption, though tariff-related stagflation risks persisted regionally.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Nvidia (+1.8%) unveiled Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin AI chips at GTC, projecting $1 trillion data center revenue by 2028. Partners like Coherent (+7%) and Supermicro (+6%) surged on AI capex optimism. Tesla (+4.5%) rebounded after Cantor Fitzgerald’s upgrade and robotaxi permit approval. Google announced a $32B acquisition of cybersecurity firm Wiz, its largest deal ever. Despite NVDA’s muted reaction, Wedbush highlighted a $8–10 tech spending multiplier per AI dollar. Analysts debated whether GTC reignited bullish momentum amid broader tech-sector volatility.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    **Market-Wide Performance:**  
The cryptocurrency market exhibited bullish momentum, with Bitcoin (+4.3% 24h, +3.1% 7d) and Ethereum (+6.7% 24h, +7.7% 7d) driving gains. Total market cap growth outpaced weekly trends, signaling accelerated short-term optimism. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) maintained stability, while XRP (+11% 24h, +13% 7d) and Solana (+7.3% 24h) led large-caps. Mid-caps like Chainlink (+8.6% 24h) and Hyperliquid (+10.1% 24h) surged.  

**Key Movers:**  
XRP’s 11% 24h rally paired with $9.2B volume marked it as the top large-cap performer. Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Uniswap (+10% 24h) saw high volume surges, reflecting speculative interest. BNB (-1.9% 24h) underperformed despite weekly gains (+8%), while Pi (-30.9% 7d) faced severe selling pressure.  

**Dominant Trends:**  
Large-caps (BTC, ETH) retained dominance, but mid-caps (XRP, LINK) outperformed, suggesting risk appetite expansion. Sector rotation into decentralized infrastructure (LINK, SOL) and DeFi (UNI) was evident. Volume spikes in altcoins contrasted with stablecoin stability, indicating capital deployment into riskier assets. The 24h/7d ratio for most assets highlighted short-term bullishness, though divergences (e.g., Pi’s crash) underscored volatility in lower-cap projects.
