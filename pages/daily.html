                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities rallied Friday, capping a volatile week driven by Trump’s tariff shifts. The S&P 500 (+1.8%), Nasdaq (+2.1%), and Dow (+1.5%) posted their best weekly gains since 2022-2023, led by tech, industrials, and financials. Bond yields surged (10-year at 4.5%), gold hit a record ($3,200/oz), and the dollar weakened. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reported mixed earnings, with CEO Jamie Dimon warning of economic “turbulence.” Consumer sentiment fell to 2022 lows amid inflation fears. China’s retaliatory 125% tariff on U.S. goods intensified trade war concerns, though markets stabilized late Friday on hopes for negotiations.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets rebounded sharply, with the Stoxx 600 rising 3.7% (best since 2021) after the EU paused retaliatory tariffs for 90 days. Germany’s DAX surged 4.67% on industrial optimism. However, analysts cautioned EU-China alignment remains unlikely due to trade disputes and geopolitical tensions. Automakers and exporters faced uncertainty as Trump’s tariffs raised risks of diverted Chinese exports to Europe. The euro strengthened to a three-year high against the dollar, reflecting shifting capital flows. Policymakers emphasized defensive trade measures to prevent dumping but avoided escalating a two-front trade war with the U.S. and China.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets were mixed: Hang Seng (+1.8%) and CSI 300 (+0.5%) rose on stimulus hopes, while Nikkei (-3.4%) and Kospi (-0.7%) fell on U.S. trade risks. China hiked tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, retaliating against Trump’s 145% levy. Tesla removed Model S/X orders in China due to tariffs, though domestic EV sales rebounded. The yuan weakened to 7.42/USD, raising devaluation concerns. Japan’s bond yields mirrored U.S. volatility, while gold and haven assets gained regionally. Exporters accelerated diversification from China-U.S. trade routes, with Vietnam and Taiwan benefiting from supply chain shifts.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks led gains: Nvidia (+3.1%) and TSMC (+4%) rose as China exempted foreign-made chips from tariffs. Tesla cut Cybertruck prices in the U.S. amid slowing demand but faced China tariff headwinds. Apple fell 4% weekly on China production risks but rebounded 5% Friday. Netflix and Amazon gained on defensive demand. U.S. chipmakers Texas Instruments (-5.7%) and Monolithic Power (+10%) diverged on tariff exemptions. Goldman Sachs upgraded Huntington Ingalls (+7.4%) on defense spending. AI and cloud infrastructure firms stabilized amid bond market turmoil, though analysts warned of earnings guidance cuts due to trade uncertainty.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The crypto market rebounded today, with Bitcoin (+5.04%) and Ethereum (+3.27%) leading a broad recovery. Total market cap increased 4.3% compared to yesterday's data, reversing recent bearish pressure as trading volumes rose in major assets like Solana (+27% volume) and Hyperliquid (+9.5% price).  

2) Solana (+8.05%) and Hyperliquid (+9.51%) were top gainers, with SOL recovering from yesterday's -5.9% drop. Bitcoin Cash (+7.45%) and Shiba Inu (+5.18%) showed strong momentum. Toncoin (-12.58% weekly) remained a notable underperformer despite slight daily gains. Stablecoins maintained peg stability.  

3) Large-caps outpaced mid/small-caps, with Bitcoin's dominance rising to 62.83%. Layer 1 protocols (SOL, BCH) and memecoins (DOGE, SHIB) led sector rotations. Positive 24h vs negative 7d changes in assets like Polkadot (-11.85% weekly vs +3.48% daily) suggest short-term bullish divergence from mid-term bearish trends. Rising volumes in gainers indicate renewed risk appetite despite lingering weekly losses across multiple assets.
