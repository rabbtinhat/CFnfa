                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equity markets slid sharply, with the S&P 500 entering correction territory (down 10% from February’s peak) amid escalating trade tensions and economic uncertainty. The Dow and Nasdaq fell 1.3% and 2%, respectively, driven by tariff fears and weaker tech performance. Intel surged 14% on its new CEO appointment, while Adobe plunged 14% on soft guidance. Discount retailers Dollar General (+7%) and Dollar Tree (+7%) outperformed as inflation concerns bolstered demand for value-oriented stocks. Treasury yields dipped as investors sought safety, reflecting growing stagflation worries amid Trump’s tariff threats and mixed inflation data.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced pressure as Trump’s threat of 200% tariffs on EU wines and spirits sparked fears of a trade war. The EU’s planned 50% tariff on U.S. whiskey intensified tensions, with French and Italian wine exporters warning of halted exports. Auto and luxury stocks lagged, while defensive sectors gained modestly. The Stoxx 600 fell 0.8%, with Germany’s DAX down 1.2%. Investors grappled with slowing economic indicators, including weaker German industrial production. European bond yields declined as risk aversion rose, though the ECB maintained a cautious stance amid persistent inflation and geopolitical headwinds.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Asia-Pacific markets were mixed amid global volatility. Japan’s Nikkei 225 ended flat, while South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.2%. India’s Nifty 50 dipped 0.2% despite cooling inflation. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Australia’s ASX 200 (-0.5%) fell on commodity weakness and trade risks. The Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) gained attention after hiring ETF executives from Cboe and Nasdaq to challenge U.S. dominance. Chinese markets wobbled as property sector concerns offset stimulus hopes. Regional tech stocks mirrored U.S. declines, with TSMC and Samsung down 1-2% on tariff-related supply chain risks.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks faced turbulence: Adobe tumbled 14% on weak guidance, while UiPath sank 14% after revenue misses. Intel surged 14% as Lip-Bu Tan’s CEO appointment fueled optimism about strategic shifts. AI-focused firms like Nvidia (-14% YTD) and AMD lagged amid sector rotation. The TXSE poached ETF leaders to compete with NYSE and Nasdaq, signaling tech-driven market disruption. Bank of America downgraded UiPath, citing macroeconomic risks. Semiconductor volatility persisted as TSMC explored a joint venture with Intel’s foundry business. Sentiment remained fragile, with analysts noting tech’s “sentiment-based” sell-off despite stable earnings fundamentals.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) **Market-wide performance**: The crypto market exhibited bearish sentiment, with most top 30 assets declining over 24 hours and steeper weekly losses. Bitcoin (-2.7% daily, -9.8% weekly) and Ethereum (-2.0% daily, -16.1% weekly) led the downturn, dragging total market cap lower. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) maintained price stability but saw elevated volumes, suggesting risk-off positioning.  

2) **Key movers**: XLM (+4.5%) was the sole top-15 gainer, outperforming with moderate volume. Bitcoin Cash (-8.4%) and Hedera (-5.3%) were notable decliners. BNB (+0.5%) showed relative resilience despite sector weakness. High volatility affected mid-caps: SUI (-23.8% weekly) and LINK (-23.9% weekly) underperformed significantly versus majors.  

3) **Dominant trends**: Accelerated selling pressure emerged, with 7-day losses doubling/tripling 24-hour declines in most assets (e.g., SOL: -3.0% daily vs -15.4% weekly). Large caps (-2% to -8% daily) fared better than mid/small caps (-3% to -23% weekly), indicating risk aversion. Sector-wide correlation suggests broad deleveraging rather than rotation, with no clear safe havens beyond stablecoins. Elevated trading volumes (-10% to -25% weekly price drops) point to capitulation, not accumulation.
