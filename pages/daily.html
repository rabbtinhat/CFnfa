                <div class="market-content">
                    North American markets showed modest gains as investors digested Nvidia's strong earnings report, which beat expectations on both revenue and earnings per share. Nvidia's stock initially surged but later stabilized, reflecting mixed sentiment amid concerns over potential U.S. tariffs on chip imports and export controls to China. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures edged up slightly, while Bitcoin continued its decline, dropping below $85,000. Investors are now focused on upcoming economic data, including U.S. GDP and jobless claims, as well as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE index, which could influence future interest rate decisions.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced headwinds due to conflicting signals from U.S. President Trump regarding tariffs on EU imports, which created uncertainty among investors. The Eurozone consumer confidence figures, set to be released later in the week, will be closely watched. Meanwhile, Nvidia's earnings failed to significantly lift sentiment in European equities, with futures pointing to a muted open. The broader market remains cautious as trade tensions and geopolitical risks continue to weigh on investor confidence, particularly in the tech and manufacturing sectors.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets traded in a tight range, with mixed performances across the region. Japan's market remained steady, while Hong Kong futures indicated a lower open. Nvidia's earnings, while strong, did not spark a significant rally in Asian tech stocks, as investors remain wary of the ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and the potential impact of tariffs on the semiconductor industry. Additionally, the rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has challenged U.S. tech giants, continues to be a focal point, raising questions about over-investment in AI infrastructure.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Nvidia's earnings dominated tech news, with the company reporting record revenue from its Blackwell AI chips and issuing optimistic guidance for Q1. However, concerns linger over potential tariffs and export controls, which could impact margins. Meanwhile, Tesla's stock continued to struggle, down 25% year-to-date, as European sales declined and competition in the EV market intensified. Other tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft also faced pressure, with shares underperforming in early 2025. Supermicro saw a rebound after submitting delayed financial reports, while Salesforce's upcoming earnings are seen as a key test for the adoption of AI agents in enterprise software.
