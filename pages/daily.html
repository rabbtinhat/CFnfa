                <h2>North America Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    North American markets experienced significant volatility, driven by a sharp sell-off in tech stocks following Nvidia's earnings report. Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations, Nvidia's stock fell 8.5% due to concerns over its lower-than-expected gross margin guidance for Q1. This decline dragged down the broader tech sector, with the Nasdaq Composite dropping 2.8% and the S&P 500 falling 1.6%. Semiconductor stocks like Micron, AMD, and TSMC also saw declines. Economic data added to the uncertainty, with jobless claims rising to 242,000, signaling potential labor market softening. Investors are now focused on the upcoming PCE inflation data for further economic clues.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced headwinds from U.S. tech sector weakness and escalating trade tensions. President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on EU imports, particularly on cars, added to market unease. The Stoxx Europe 600 index declined, with tech and semiconductor-related stocks under pressure. Rolls-Royce was a notable exception, surging 14.3% after strong earnings and a share buyback announcement. However, broader concerns over global trade and economic growth weighed on sentiment, with investors closely monitoring the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on European exports and the region's economic outlook.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets were poised for declines following Wall Street's tech-led sell-off and mixed economic signals. Futures for Japan and Australia indicated losses, with Nvidia's earnings disappointment and U.S. tariff threats contributing to the negative sentiment. The yen weakened against the dollar, while oil prices rose on fears of supply disruptions due to tariffs on Canada and Mexico. In India, officials explored tariff reductions to mitigate the impact of U.S. trade policies. Investors also awaited key economic data, including Tokyo inflation and India's Q4 GDP, for further direction amid growing global economic uncertainty.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Nvidia's earnings dominated tech sector news, with its stock falling 8.5% despite strong revenue and earnings beats. Concerns over lower gross margins and pricing pressure overshadowed the company's robust AI-driven growth, particularly from its Blackwell GPUs. Other tech stocks, including Dell, Super Micro Computer, and AMD, also declined. Meanwhile, Tesla's application to operate a ride-hailing service in California weighed on Uber's shares. In Asia, TSMC's collaboration with Nvidia on AI chips highlighted the growing demand for AI infrastructure, though U.S.-listed shares of TSMC fell nearly 7% amid broader market weakness.

                <div class="market-content">
                    The cryptocurrency market showed mixed, mostly subdued movements today. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) saw minor 24-hour declines of -0.17% and -2.71%, respectively, with broader market sentiment cautious as most top cryptocurrencies posted weekly losses exceeding -10% to -20%. Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USDC remained stable. Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) were among the few gainers, rising +1.0% and +1.7% in 24 hours, while Sui (SUI), Stellar (XLM), and Cardano (ADA) faced sharper declines. The market continues to correct from recent highs, with double-digit weekly losses and heightened volatility in mid-cap assets.
