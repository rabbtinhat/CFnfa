                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities plummeted Monday, with the S&P 500 down 1.7% (worst day of 2025) and Nasdaq dropping 2.6%, driven by President Trump’s confirmation of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting March 4. The Dow fell 650 points, led by tech sell-offs (Nvidia -8.7%). Tariff fears overshadowed weak economic data, including slowing consumer spending. Energy stocks also declined as OPEC+ plans to boost oil output. Cryptocurrencies pared gains after Trump’s strategic reserve announcement, with Bitcoin retreating from $95k to $86k. Investors await Friday’s jobs report and retail earnings (Target, Costco) for economic clarity.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European equities rose Monday, contrasting U.S. declines, amid hopes for a Ukraine peace deal and defense spending plans. The euro rebounded 0.9% against the dollar, supported by ECB rate-cut expectations and Eurozone inflation easing to 2.4%. Energy stocks underperformed as oil slid. Germany’s potential defense and infrastructure funds bolstered sentiment. The STOXX 600 gained 1.2%, led by industrials and financials. Investors focused on Thursday’s ECB meeting for policy cues. U.K. markets were buoyed by King Charles III-backed sustainable agriculture initiatives, though broader EU growth concerns lingered amid tariff-related trade risks.

                    Asia-Pacific markets were mixed: Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.5% as Mixue’s IPO surged 43% on debut, while mainland China’s CSI 300 fell 1.2% amid EV weakness (Nio -8.6%, Li Auto -10.9%). Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.8% as M&A activity boosted small-caps. India’s Nifty 50 slid 0.6% on tariff retaliation fears. South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 1.1% amid tech sector pressure. Cryptocurrency-linked stocks (Samsung, Coinbase Asia) fluctuated post-Trump’s crypto reserve update. Investors monitored U.S.-China trade tensions and Japan’s corporate reforms driving small-cap outperformance.

                    Tech led declines: Nvidia sank 8.7% on reports of AI chips reaching China via third parties, sparking regulatory probes. Dell (-7%) and Super Micro (-13%) also fell. Tesla dropped 2% despite Morgan Stanley’s $430 price target, citing AI/robotics potential. Broadcom (-6%) and Intel (+3.5% early) fluctuated on chip partnership rumors. AppLovin surged 3.6% after a $500M buyback plan. Autonomous trucking firm Aurora Innovation rose 3% premarket on Morgan Stanley’s bullish initiation. Crypto stocks (Coinbase, MicroStrategy) pared gains post-Trump’s weekend crypto reserve announcement. AI chip earnings (Broadcom, Marvell) eyed this week.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    **Overview**  
Today's crypto market shows mixed movements among the top 30 assets. Bitcoin (+3.5%) and BNB (+3.2%) led gains, while Ethereum (-0.5%) and Solana (-2.4%) lagged. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) held steady, reflecting neutral sentiment. The global crypto market cap remains volatile, with most assets down sharply over the past week.  

**Highlights**  
Hedera (HBAR) surged 15.2%, and Stellar (XLM) rose 10.0%, marking the day’s top performers. Dogecoin (+4.8%) and Bitcoin Cash (+5.2%) also rallied. Conversely, Hyperliquid (-3.8%) and Toncoin (-2.1%) faced pressure. Aptos (+4.6%) defied weekly trends with a 5.6% seven-day rise, contrasting with broader declines.  

**Market Trend**  
Short-term rebounds in Bitcoin and select altcoins suggest tentative recovery attempts, though weekly losses (-8.5% to -22.1% for major assets) underscore persistent bearish pressure. High volatility persists, with stablecoin volumes indicating cautious capital preservation. Sector-wide, technical retracements dominate, but intraday rallies in mid-cap tokens hint at sporadic risk appetite.
