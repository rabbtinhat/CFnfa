                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities closed sharply lower, led by tech and auto stocks, as President Trump’s impending auto tariffs (25% on non-U.S.-made cars) fueled trade war fears. The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, Dow lost 0.4%, and Nasdaq slid 2%, with Tesla (-5.6%) and Nvidia (-5.7%) among the worst performers. GameStop surged 11.7% after announcing bitcoin purchases but slid 8% post-market on a $1.3B fundraising plan. Durable goods orders beat expectations, but weak retail sales and recession concerns weighed. Treasury yields rose (10-year at 4.35%) amid economic ambiguity and tariff-driven market volatility.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced pressure from U.S. auto tariff risks, with Tesla’s European registrations dropping 40% YoY in February. Germany’s DAX gained 1.13% on improved business sentiment, but automakers like Volkswagen and BMW declined on tariff fears. SAP (+1.3%) became Europe’s most valuable firm ($343B market cap) amid tech resilience. Copper prices hit records on accelerated U.S. tariff plans. The STOXX 600 rose 0.67%, though auto sector underperformance and EU-China trade tensions persisted.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets grappled with U.S.-China trade tensions, as Chinese environmental rules targeting Nvidia’s H20 chips added pressure. BYD’s 2024 revenue ($107B) surpassed Tesla’s, driven by hybrid sales and new battery tech. Japan’s Nikkei dipped 0.3% on yen volatility, while Hang Seng fell 1.1% amid tech sell-offs. Chinese EV stocks retreated on tariff risks, though Alibaba and Tencent stabilized. Copper demand optimism lifted Australian miners (BHP +2.1%). Regional indices traded mixed, with MSCI Asia-Pacific down 0.6% as investors awaited clarity on U.S. tariff implementation.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks led declines (Nasdaq -2%) on tariff fears and China headwinds. Nvidia fell 5.7% due to Chinese chip restrictions and TD Cowen’s report of Microsoft canceling data center projects. Tesla slid 5.6% on weak European sales and Musk’s political controversies. AI sector concerns grew as Marvell’s outlook and Meta/Google’s data center shifts spooked investors. SailPoint dropped 1% despite strong earnings, while cybersecurity demand stayed robust. Super Micro (-8.9%) and Arista (-6.1%) extended losses. GameStop’s bitcoin pivot (+11.7%) mirrored MicroStrategy’s strategy, though analysts questioned sustainability.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) **Market-wide performance:** The crypto market saw moderate declines, with Bitcoin (-0.69%) and Ethereum (-2.71%) leading losses among large caps. Total market cap dipped slightly, though weekly trends show resilience (BTC +1.87% weekly). Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) maintained peg stability.  

2) **Key movers:** Memecoins outperformed - DOGE (+2.16%, $2.07B volume), SHIB (+3.74%, $573M volume), and PEPE (+6.25%, $1.01B volume) surged. SUI (+7.11%) and TON (+1.79%) led mid-caps. MANTRA (-4.72%) and Hyperliquid (-13.22%) were notable losers.  

3) **Dominant trends:** Memecoins extended weekly rallies (DOGE +11.86%, PEPE +17.23%), contrasting with ETH’s 7-day decline (-1.36%). Sector rotation favored risk-on assets, while infrastructure coins (SOL -4.40%, AVAX -4.15%) cooled after recent strength. Mid-caps showed divergence, with SUI (+9.24% weekly) gaining momentum while privacy coins (XMR +6.59% weekly) held steady. Trading volumes rose for outperforming altcoins, suggesting selective capital allocation despite broader caution.
