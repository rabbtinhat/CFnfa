                <h2>North America Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    North American equities rose modestly, with the S&P 500 (+0.8%), Dow Jones (+0.7%), and Nasdaq (+0.6%) gaining amid tariff-related optimism. Auto stocks (GM, Ford, Stellantis) surged over 3% after President Trump hinted at potential tariff relief for imported vehicles/parts. However, Goldman Sachs downgraded hotel stocks (Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton) citing weakening consumer demand and recession risks. Retail sales data (due Wednesday) is anticipated to show a 1.2% monthly increase, driven by pre-tariff consumer spending. Volatility persisted as conflicting tariff signals from Trump’s administration tempered gains, with bond yields falling and stagflation concerns lingering.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets mirrored global gains but lagged behind U.S. equities, with tech stocks rising 2.6% following tariff exemptions on electronics. The dollar weakened to multi-year lows, while short-term Treasury yields fell sharply. Argentina’s peso plummeted 10% after a new FX regime, though equities rallied 4%. Broader European indices faced pressure from economic uncertainty, with airlines (Delta, Southwest) cutting forecasts and dragging travel-related sectors. Analysts noted muted optimism due to unresolved tariff risks and potential stagflationary impacts, though earnings season provided some relief (e.g., Goldman Sachs’ profit beat).

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets rallied, led by Hong Kong-listed Chinese tech stocks (+2%) for a fifth consecutive session, buoyed by temporary U.S. tariff exemptions on electronics. Exporters like Alibaba (+5.8%) and JD.com (+4.8%) surged, though Beijing remains cautious in evaluating tariff impacts. Auto and semiconductor sectors gained on hopes of eased trade tensions, but analysts warned of lingering risks from Trump’s shifting policies. Japan and South Korea saw modest gains, though regional sentiment was tempered by China’s slowing growth and U.S. threats to expand semiconductor tariffs.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks rebounded as Trump exempted smartphones, computers, and semiconductors from tariffs. Apple (+2%) and chipmakers (Nvidia, AMD) rose, though gains faded amid conflicting signals on long-term exemptions. Palantir (+4.6%) surged after NATO adopted its AI military system. Dell (+4%) and Intel (+3%) advanced on tariff relief, while cybersecurity concerns hit DaVita (-3%) following a ransomware attack. Despite the reprieve, analysts warned of ongoing volatility as the White House considers expanding sector-specific tariffs, with tech earnings (e.g., UnitedHealth) and supply-chain disruptions remaining focal points.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The cryptocurrency market showed moderate gains, with the total market cap of top coins increasing slightly. Bitcoin (+1.39%) and Ethereum (+2.01%) led large-cap growth, while Bitcoin's 6.78% weekly gain signals strengthening mid-term momentum. Stablecoins maintained peg stability with minimal price fluctuations.

2) Solana (+2%, 19.55% weekly) and Avalanche (+3.48%, 19.72% weekly) emerged as altcoin leaders, with Solana's $4.58B 24h volume exceeding yesterday's $3.97B. Monero surged 6.34% despite broader privacy coin stagnation. Bitcoin Cash (-4.79%) and Dogecoin (-2.45%) underperformed despite weekly gains of 17.87% and 5.58% respectively, suggesting profit-taking.

3) Sector rotation favored smart contract platforms, with ETH and SOL outperforming Bitcoin's weekly growth. Mid-caps like AVAX and Hedera (+9.39% weekly) showed stronger momentum than large caps, while Hyperliquid's 34.24% weekly surge highlights concentrated speculation in newer tokens. Trading volumes increased 7% among top movers versus yesterday, indicating renewed altcoin interest despite Bitcoin's 62.8% market dominance holding steady.
