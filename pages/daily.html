                <h2>North America Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    North American markets closed mixed on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.4%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was weighed down by declines in major players like Tesla and Nvidia. Tesla’s stock fell 8.4% after reports of a 45% drop in European sales in January, contributing to a 25% year-to-date decline. Nvidia also slid 2.8% ahead of its earnings report, as investors grappled with potential delays in its Blackwell AI chip rollout and concerns over stricter U.S. export controls on semiconductors to China. Meanwhile, consumer confidence plummeted in February, raising fears of an economic slowdown, and Treasury yields fell to their lowest levels since December, reflecting growing bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced headwinds as Tesla’s declining sales in the region highlighted broader challenges for the EV maker. Tesla’s European registrations dropped 45% year-over-year in January, with significant declines in key markets like Germany, France, and the UK. This contrasts with a 37.3% overall increase in European EV sales, driven by strong demand for models from Volkswagen, Renault, and Chinese automakers like BYD. Tesla’s struggles were compounded by CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities, which have sparked backlash in Europe. Meanwhile, European automakers are capitalizing on Tesla’s woes, with competitive offerings gaining traction. The region’s markets also reacted to global economic uncertainty, with investors closely monitoring U.S. tariff policies and their potential impact on trade.

                <h2>Asia Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets were poised for a mixed open following a decline in U.S. equities, as concerns over slowing economic growth and rising inflation expectations weighed on sentiment. Tesla’s challenges extended to Asia, where its partially automated driving system upgrades in China reportedly disappointed customers, further pressuring its stock. Chinese EV makers like BYD and Li Auto continued to gain market share, with Li Auto’s stock surging 12% after revealing images of its new electric SUV, the i8. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report and potential delays in its Blackwell AI chip ramp-up were closely watched, given the company’s significant role in the global AI supply chain. Investors also remained cautious amid U.S.-China trade tensions and potential tariff escalations.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks faced significant volatility, with Tesla and Nvidia leading declines. Tesla’s stock fell sharply after reporting a 45% drop in European sales and facing criticism over its self-driving technology in China. Nvidia slid 2.8% amid concerns over Blackwell chip delays and stricter U.S. export controls on AI technology to China. However, Super Micro Computer surged 15.5% in after-hours trading after meeting Nasdaq’s deadline to file delayed financial reports, avoiding delisting. Lucid Motors also saw a post-market boost, rising 8% after announcing better-than-expected earnings and a leadership transition. The tech sector remains under pressure from macroeconomic uncertainty, with investors closely monitoring earnings reports and geopolitical developments.
