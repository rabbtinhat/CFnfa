                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. markets rebounded cautiously, led by megacap tech stocks, with the Nasdaq up 1.2% and S&P 500 gaining 0.5%, while the Dow dipped 0.2%. Nvidia (+6%) and Tesla (+7%) surged, buoyed by moderating core CPI (3.1% YoY, lowest since 2021). However, trade tensions persisted as Canada/EU retaliated against U.S. tariffs. Intel jumped 11% post-market on CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s appointment and reports of a TSMC-led consortium eyeing its manufacturing unit. JPMorgan slashed Tesla’s price target amid delivery concerns, though shares rallied with broader tech.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced pressure amid U.S. tariff uncertainty and recession fears, though specific indices were less covered. Trade war risks dominated sentiment, with EU counter-tariffs on $28B U.S. goods adding to volatility. Defensive sectors like healthcare underperformed as investors rotated into beaten-down tech. Inflation concerns lingered despite softer U.S. CPI, with focus on potential spillover from tariffs. Automakers saw mixed reactions; Nissan rose slightly on CEO transition news, while broader industrials remained cautious amid supply chain risks.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed: Japan’s Nikkei flat, South Korea’s Kospi up 1.5%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.4%. India’s inflation eased to 3.98% (Feb), boosting sentiment. Nissan (+0.6%) rose on CEO change, though Honda dipped. China’s 10-year bond yield neared 2%, reflecting growth concerns. U.S. tariff threats and weaker Tesla sales in Europe/Asia weighed on regional automakers. Japan’s wholesale inflation slowed to 4%, keeping BOJ rate hikes in focus. Indian equities lagged despite strong IPO momentum, with Nifty down 0.6%.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Intel surged 11% after naming Lip-Bu Tan CEO and reports of a TSMC-Nvidia-Broadcom consortium eyeing its manufacturing arm. Tesla gained 7.6% despite U.S./global sales declines and JPMorgan’s bearish delivery forecast. Microsoft dipped briefly on FTC antitrust probe updates. Marvell Tech plunged (-40% YTD) despite data center AI growth, citing weak non-AI segments. Adobe fell 3% on soft guidance. Broader tech rallied on cooling CPI, though trade risks persisted. Morgan Stanley highlighted Tesla’s AI/autonomy potential, while Evercore cut delivery estimates amid brand erosion tied to Musk’s political activities.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Overview: The cryptocurrency market showed mixed movements today, with most top assets rebounding from weekly losses despite lingering bearish pressures. Bitcoin (+4.3%) and Ethereum (+2.1%) led gains among majors, while stablecoins USDT and USDC held steady. 
Highlight: XRP (+6.6%), Dogecoin (+6.6%), and Avalanche (+7.0%) outperformed, with Sui (+7.1%) and Aptos (+5.9%) posting notable gains. TRON (-2.4%) was a rare decliner. Bitcoin’s market cap surpassed $1.64T, reflecting renewed institutional interest.  
Market Trend: Short-term recovery dominated, with 24-hour gains offsetting broader weekly declines (BTC: -5.4%, ETH: -11.3%, SOL: -13.5%). Mid-cap assets like Cardano (+6.7%) and Bitcoin Cash (+2.2%) mirrored this rebound. Volatility persisted as traders balanced technical retracements against macroeconomic uncertainty, with stablecoin volumes signaling cautious capital rotation.
