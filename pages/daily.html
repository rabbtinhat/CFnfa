                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities traded lower amid ongoing tariff uncertainty, with the S&P 500 down 0.2%, Dow shedding 0.4%, and Nasdaq dipping 0.1%. Trade-sensitive sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials lagged, while financials gained on strong earnings from Bank of America and Citigroup. Boeing fell 2% after China halted jet deliveries, and United Airlines surged 7% post-earnings despite tariff-related demand concerns. Defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples outperformed as recession fears grew. Treasury yields remained elevated near 4.5%, reflecting policy uncertainty. Analysts highlighted volatility in bond markets and mixed corporate guidance on tariff impacts.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced pressure from U.S. tariff spillovers, with autos and tech stocks volatile. The STOXX 600 edged lower as trade-exposed sectors weighed, though tech rallied briefly on exemptions for electronics. EU tariffs on U.S. goods and Trump’s 20% levies on European imports fueled stagflation concerns. Defensive sectors like utilities and healthcare saw inflows, while luxury goods and industrials lagged. The euro weakened against the dollar amid capital outflows. ECB policymakers cautioned that prolonged trade disruptions could delay rate cuts. Airlines like Lufthansa mirrored U.S. peers’ turbulence amid tariff-related demand uncertainty.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets declined as China’s 84% retaliatory tariffs intensified trade tensions. The Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and Shanghai Composite dropped 1.2%, with tech and export-heavy stocks underperforming. Japan’s Nikkei slid 0.9% on yen strength and auto-sector risks. Chinese airlines halted Boeing purchases, deepening manufacturing strain. India’s Sensex outperformed, rising 0.5% on domestic demand optimism. Stagflation fears and capital flight to safe havens pressured regional currencies. Semiconductor stocks in Taiwan and South Korea rebounded modestly on U.S. chip tariff exemptions, though AI-related firms faced headwinds from Chinese tech competition.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks saw mixed trading: Apple dropped 2% on China manufacturing risks, while Netflix rose 4.8% on ambitious 2030 growth targets. Nvidia slid 5% after a $5.5B export charge but gained earlier on Trump’s AI infrastructure pledge. Meta’s Llama 4 AI launch and Palantir’s NATO contract drove gains. Semiconductor stocks like Intel and AMD fluctuated with tariff exemptions. U.S. scrutiny of Chinese AI (DeepSeek) and Lightmatter’s optical chips highlighted sector competition. Streaming and ad-tech outperformed, while hardware firms faced supply-chain risks. Tariff exemptions for smartphones provided limited relief amid broader policy uncertainty.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) Market-wide performance: The crypto market saw moderate pullbacks today, with Bitcoin (-0.73%) and Ethereum (-1.33%) leading broad declines across large caps. Total market cap decreased slightly as trading volumes contracted (~$27B BTC volume vs $34B yesterday), suggesting reduced momentum after recent gains. Most assets retained positive 7-day performance (BTC +9.22%, ETH +8.64%), indicating mid-term bullishness despite short-term profit-taking.

2) Key movers: Solana (-1.06% today, +21.2% weekly) and Hyperliquid (-2.67% today, +37.24% weekly) showed elevated volatility. Pi token plunged -12.48% today, reversing part of its +13.38% weekly gain. Toncoin (+1.87%) bucked the bearish trend with moderate gains. Mid-caps like Cardano (-3.02%) and Avalanche (-3.97%) underperformed BTC/ETH.

3) Dominant trends: Sector rotation emerged as money flowed from mid-cap alts (-3% avg daily loss) back to large caps (-1% avg). Stablecoin volumes remained elevated (USDT $54B), signaling liquidity retention. The divergence between strong weekly gains (+5-20% for most assets) and today's retracement suggests consolidation after a sustained rally, with large caps showing relative stability compared to volatile small/mid-caps.
