                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities whipsawed amid tariff uncertainty, with the S&P 500 falling 0.2% (third straight loss), Dow dropping 0.9%, and Nasdaq edging up 0.1%. Markets reacted sharply to conflicting headlines about a potential 90-day tariff pause, later denied by the White House. Trump threatened additional 50% tariffs on China starting April 9 if retaliatory levies remain. JPMorgan’s Dimon and BlackRock’s Fink warned of slower growth and recession risks. Bond yields surged, with the 10-year Treasury up 17 basis points. Defensive sectors like Real Estate underperformed, while Tech and Communication Services stabilized late.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European stocks plunged (Stoxx 600 down 4.2%) as EU leaders urged calm amid escalating trade tensions. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 fell sharply on fears of auto-sector tariffs and recession risks. EU officials debated retaliatory measures but emphasized avoiding "nervous decisions." Export-heavy economies like Germany face direct impacts from U.S. tariffs, while Poland warned of GDP contraction. Analysts flagged risks to inflation, labor markets, and foreign investment. The euro weakened as bond yields rose, reflecting stagflation concerns.

                    Asian markets extended losses, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 10.4% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling 6.3%. China’s CSI 300 dropped 6.3% after Beijing imposed 34% tariffs on U.S. goods. Regional manufacturing hubs (Taiwan, South Korea) saw tech and export stocks pressured by supply-chain risks. The yen strengthened as a safe-haven asset, while Japan intervened to stabilize bond markets. Analysts warned of prolonged volatility as Trump’s tariffs threaten Asia’s export-driven growth. India and Southeast Asian markets also declined, with MSCI Asia-Pacific down 7.1%.

Sector ETFs (XLK, XLC) closed positive, contrasting with broader market declines. However, Apple fell 5% on China exposure risks, while semiconductor stocks faced tariff-driven supply-chain concerns. Chinese ADRs (Alibaba, JD.com) plunged 8–11% on U.S.-China trade tensions. Broadcom authorized a $10B buyback, but chipmakers with overseas production (Taiwan, Mexico) remained volatile. Tech’s resilience highlighted its dual role as growth driver and tariff vulnerability.
