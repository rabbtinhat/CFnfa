                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. stocks suffered their worst single-day decline since 2020, with the Dow plunging 1,700 points (-4%), the S&P 500 sinking 4.8%, and the Nasdaq plummeting 6%. The sell-off followed President Trump’s sweeping tariffs, including a 54% rate on China and 46% on Vietnam. Tech giants (Apple -9%, Nvidia -7%) and furniture retailers (RH -40%, Wayfair -25%) were hardest hit. Defensive sectors like fast-food chains (McDonald’s +2%) and healthcare outperformed. Treasury yields fell sharply (10-year at 4.05%), reflecting recession fears. The Russell 2000 small-cap index entered bear territory (-6.4%).

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets slumped, with the Stoxx 600 down 2.5%, as Trump’s 20% EU tariffs fueled trade war concerns. Auto stocks (Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW -3%) declined, though losses were muted due to exemptions for USMCA-compliant goods. Defense firms Leonardo, Airbus, and Thales rallied on plans for a satellite alliance to counter SpaceX’s Starlink. The U.K. FTSE 100 fell 2.1%, pressured by luxury and industrial sectors. Investors shifted to bonds, with German 10-year yields dropping 12 bps.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets tumbled, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 2.7% and Vietnam’s VN-Index plunging 6% due to a 46% U.S. tariff. Emerging-market currencies diverged: Mexico’s peso rose 1.8%, while the Thai baht and yuan weakened. China’s credit rating was downgraded by Fitch (A to A+). Taiwan’s TAIEX slid 3.2% amid semiconductor tariff risks. India’s Sensex fell 1.8% on global growth fears. South Korean tech stocks (Samsung -4%) mirrored U.S. tech declines.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks led the sell-off: Apple (-9%) faced supply-chain risks from China tariffs, while Nvidia (-7%) and chipmakers (AMD -9%, Qualcomm -9.5%) slumped on tariff uncertainty. Dell (-19%) and HP (-15%) plunged on higher import costs. Cybersecurity firms (Palo Alto, CrowdStrike) were highlighted as defensive plays. Microsoft (-2.4%) dropped after scaling back data-center projects. Semiconductor tariffs were deferred but remain a risk. AI chip demand concerns grew amid reports of delayed data-center investments. Chinese tech firms (Alibaba) stockpiled Nvidia chips ahead of potential U.S. export restrictions.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The crypto market saw broad declines, with total capitalization dropping as top coins faced accelerated selling pressure. Bitcoin (-2.5%) and Ethereum (-2.8%) underperformed their 7-day trends (-5.6% and -10.3% respectively), indicating worsening short-term sentiment.  

2) Solana (-6.6%) and Hyperliquid (-7.4%) were notable underperformers, with Solana's weekly loss deepening to -16.2%. MANTRA (+1.8%) bucked the trend as the sole gainer among top 30 assets. Tether's $84B 24h volume (+2.5% from yesterday) highlighted risk-off flows.  

3) Bearish momentum intensified across market caps, with mid-caps like Chainlink (-18.1% weekly) and Avalanche (-18.1% weekly) showing disproportionate weakness versus large caps. Stablecoin volumes rose while altcoin volumes declined, signaling capital preservation over risk appetite. The uniform red across 24h/7d metrics suggests sector-wide capitulation rather than rotation.
