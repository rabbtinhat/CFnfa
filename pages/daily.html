                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. markets plunged sharply, with the Dow tumbling 1,700 points (-4%), the S&P 500 sinking 4.8%, and the Nasdaq plummeting 6%—their worst day since 2020. Megacap tech stocks (Apple, Nvidia) fell 7-9% on tariff-driven supply chain concerns, while small caps (Russell 2000) entered bear territory. Defensive sectors like fast food (McDonald’s, Yum Brands) and healthcare (Molina, Centene) outperformed. Furniture retailers (RH, Wayfair) collapsed 25-40% on Asian tariff exposure. Treasury yields dropped (10-year at 4.05%), reflecting recession fears. The March jobs report is eyed for pre-tariff economic health.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets (Stoxx 600 -2.5%) fell as Trump’s tariffs targeted the EU (20%) and auto imports. Auto stocks (Volkswagen, BMW) slid 3-4.5%, though exemptions for Canada/Mexico via USMCA softened losses. Defense stocks gained focus as Leonardo, Airbus, and Thales advanced plans for a satellite alliance to rival SpaceX’s Starlink. The EU faces existing steel/auto tariffs and retaliatory risks. The euro rose against a weaker dollar, while bond yields mirrored U.S. declines. Analysts warned of prolonged trade disputes and margin pressures across manufacturing sectors.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets slumped, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 (-2.7%) and Vietnam’s index (-6%) hit hardest by tariffs (46% on Vietnam, 54% on China). China’s yuan fell after Fitch downgraded its credit rating. Mexico’s benchmark surged 2% intraday (closed +0.5%) on tariff exemptions. Emerging-market currencies (Mexican peso +1.8%) rose as the dollar index dropped 1.5%. Thailand’s baht and Sri Lankan bonds fell on higher tariffs. Taiwan’s tech-heavy market sank (-3%) due to 32% duties. Investors shifted to Latin American equities (MSCI LatAm +1.4%) as regional supply chains faced fewer disruptions.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks led the sell-off: Apple (-9%) and Nvidia (-7%) fell on China/Vietnam tariff risks, while Dell (-19%) and HP (-15%) sank on hardware cost concerns. Cybersecurity firms (Palo Alto, CrowdStrike) were highlighted as defensive plays amid rising cyber threats. Microsoft (-2.4%) pared losses despite scaling back data center projects. The “Magnificent Seven” lost $1 trillion collectively. Semiconductor tariffs remain a risk, with Bernstein warning demand destruction from higher-priced electronics. AI chip demand faced uncertainty as Cloud providers (Microsoft, CoreWeave) delayed expansions. China’s DeepSeek AI advancements added competitive pressures.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) Market-wide performance: The crypto market declined broadly, with total market cap dropping ~2.5% from yesterday's levels. Bitcoin (-2.5%) and Ethereum (-2.8%) led large-cap losses, while mid/small-caps like Solana (-6.6%) and Hyperliquid (-7.4%) saw sharper declines. The 7-day losses accelerated across most assets, with Bitcoin's weekly drop expanding from -2.8% to -5.6%.

2) Key movers: MANTRA (OM) gained 1.8% against the trend with $100M volume. Hyperliquid (HYPE) became the worst performer (-7.4% daily, -21.4% weekly) despite 56% volume surge. Solana volumes rose 16.8% alongside its price decline, suggesting capitulation. Pi token collapsed 14.1% daily (-30.5% weekly) with 75% volume spike.

3) Dominant trends: Mid-caps underperformed large caps significantly - Solana, Avalanche (-3.9%), and Sui (-5%) fell harder than BTC/ETH. Stablecoin volumes increased (USDT +2.5%, USDC +3%), indicating risk-off flows. The accelerated 24h declines versus 7d performance across 80% of top coins suggests bearish momentum strengthening, particularly in smart contract platforms and memecoins.
