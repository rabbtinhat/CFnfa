                    U.S. equities surged sharply after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs (excluding China) and raised China tariffs to 125%. The S&P 500 (+9.5%) and Nasdaq (+12.1%) posted their largest gains since 2008 and 2001, respectively, driven by tech stocks like Nvidia (+18%), Tesla (+22%), and Apple (+15%). Bond yields spiked, with the 10-year Treasury nearing 4.4%. Airlines (Delta, United) and semiconductors (AMD, Microchip) rallied, while pharmaceutical stocks (Pfizer, Eli Lilly) fell on tariff concerns. Volatility (VIX) dropped sharply as markets priced in reduced trade war risks for non-China partners.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets reacted to the U.S. tariff pause, with DAX futures signaling a 5% opening gain. The EU’s planned 25% tariff on $23B of U.S. goods remains pending, though paused U.S. reciprocal tariffs lowered EU-bound levies to 10%. Auto and steel sectors (25% tariffs unchanged) faced lingering uncertainty. The euro strengthened modestly amid reduced immediate trade risks, while the European Central Bank monitored bond yield volatility. Energy stocks lagged as U.S. crude fell 6.7% to $55.57. Investors await EU-China coordination amid Beijing’s retaliatory 84% U.S. tariff hike.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets rebounded preemptively: Nikkei futures rose 10% on U.S. tariff relief hopes, while China’s offshore yuan hit a record low (7.4287/USD) amid trade war escalations. Japan and Canada agreed to stabilize markets, but Chinese equities remained pressured by 125% U.S. tariffs and weak export outlooks. BYD expanded in Europe despite EU duties, launching its premium Denza brand. India and Vietnam faced tariff uncertainty, though Vietnam proposed 0% tariffs on U.S. goods. Analysts cut China’s 2025 GDP forecasts (Citi: 4.2%) as Beijing hinted at stimulus to counter trade headwinds.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks led the U.S. rally: Apple (+15%) rebounded despite China exposure, while Nvidia (+18%) and Tesla (+22%) surged on AI/EV optimism. AMD (+23.8%) rose despite a KeyBanc downgrade, citing margin risks. IBM defended by Evercore ISI (+22% upside) for consulting and AI growth. Semiconductor firms (Microchip, Monolithic) jumped 20%+ on tariff relief. Chinese tech (Alibaba, JD.com) gained 5-6% despite tensions. Constellation Energy (+2%) upgraded at Citi on nuclear/data center prospects. Affirm rose 1% on Evercore’s buy call, while Ford (-2%) downgraded by Bernstein on tariff risks.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The crypto market rallied sharply today, with Bitcoin (+8.1%) and Ethereum (+13.5%) leading a broad recovery. Total top 30 market cap increased significantly, supported by 24-hour trading volume surges across major assets. This follows a week of negative momentum, as most coins still show negative 7-day changes (BTC -1.7%, ETH -10.1%) despite today's gains.

2) Chainlink (+15.9%), Avalanche (+15.4%), and Hyperliquid (+26.4%) were top performers, with Hyperliquid's volume spiking 64% alongside its price surge. Mid-caps like XRP (+14.3%), Cardano (+14.3%), and Shiba Inu (+12.7%) outperformed Bitcoin's gains. Solana (+12.7%) and Dogecoin (+13.5%) saw both price growth and volume increases above $7B each.

3) Large-caps drove market momentum while mid-caps showed greater volatility, suggesting renewed risk appetite. The sector-wide rebound contrasts with persistent weekly losses, indicating potential short-covering or bullish sentiment reversal. Stablecoins maintained peg stability despite increased trading activity, with USDT volume rising 70% to $138B. Newer assets like Hyperliquid demonstrated outsized moves compared to established projects.
