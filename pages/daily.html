                <div class="market-content">
                    US equities surged, with the S&P 500 up 1.7%, Dow Jones 1.4%, and Nasdaq 2.3%, driven by optimism over narrower-than-expected Trump tariffs set for April 2. Tesla soared 12% on eased auto tariff fears, while tech stocks rallied after Ant Group’s AI cost-cutting news. Treasury yields rose (10-year at 4.33%) as risk appetite rebounded. 23andMe collapsed 59% post-bankruptcy filing. Focus remains on Friday’s PCE inflation data and earnings from Lululemon, GameStop, and Dollar Tree. Steel producers gained on tariff protections, while utilities like AEP raised capital for AI-driven grid upgrades.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets saw muted activity with limited direct updates, though regional trade tensions lingered. EU delayed retaliatory tariffs on US goods (including whiskey) until mid-April, easing near-term concerns. Auto and export-heavy sectors remained sensitive to US tariff developments, particularly after Trump’s threat of secondary tariffs on Venezuela-bound trade partners. The Stoxx 600 traded flat, reflecting caution ahead of US policy clarity. Canada’s retaliatory tariffs on $20B US goods and ongoing USMCA negotiations added cross-Atlantic uncertainty. UK regulators continued probing 23andMe’s data breach, highlighting regulatory risks for transatlantic firms.

China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng met global CEOs (Apple, Pfizer) to stabilize foreign investment ties. Japan’s yen weakened past 150/USD as Treasury yields rose. South Korea’s FuriosaAI rejected Meta’s $800M bid, underscoring local AI sector confidence. Exporters monitored US tariff exemptions for the “dirty 15” nations, with China’s retaliatory farm tariffs active since March 10. India and ASEAN markets awaited clearer US trade policy signals.
