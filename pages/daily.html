                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. equities declined Thursday, reversing gains from the Fed’s rate hold, as tariff concerns and growth fears resurfaced. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, Nasdaq dropped 0.3%, and Dow closed flat. Fed Chair Powell’s inflation warnings and Trump’s tariff threats weighed on sentiment. Nike shares slid 4% post-earnings, citing tariff impacts on margins. Major banks (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs) announced layoffs amid economic uncertainty. Copper prices surged near record highs on U.S. tariff speculation. JPMorgan noted households’ heavy equity exposure raises valuation risks if retail flows reverse.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets saw mixed performance amid U.S. policy spillovers. The STOXX Europe 600 rose 9% YTD, buoyed by defense spending optimism in Germany (DAX +15% YTD). However, Trump’s potential NATO withdrawal and trade uncertainty limited gains. European automakers like Stellantis dipped 3.6% on tariff risks. Accenture’s 7% drop on federal contract cuts under Trump’s efficiency drive echoed in European tech services. Investors shifted focus to domestic infrastructure and defense stocks as U.S. trade tensions escalated.

                    Asian markets diverged, with China outperforming (iShares MSCI China ETF +21% YTD) on DeepSeek’s AI advancements and defense spending hikes. Japan lagged amid yen volatility. Emerging markets benefited from U.S. tariff fears, with iShares MSCI EM ETF up 7% YTD. Copper demand optimism lifted Australian mining stocks. However, Taiwan Semiconductor’s Arizona expansion faced scrutiny as Nvidia diversifies supply chains ahead of potential U.S.-China trade disruptions. Investors monitored Fed policy ripple effects and Trump’s tariff timeline for April.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech stocks remained volatile. The “Magnificent Seven” (excluding Nvidia, Meta) underperformed, with Tesla down 50% from highs. Nvidia rose 2% post-GTC as analysts backed its AI roadmap, though shares remain 15% below peaks. Apple’s streaming service lost $1B/year amid competition. Accenture slid 7% on federal spending cuts tied to Trump’s DOGE initiative. Smaller tech firms (Root, IonQ) gained attention as investors diversified from megacaps. Meta (+0.7%) and cybersecurity plays (Trellix) rose on stable demand. Tesla’s recall and Musk’s focus concerns persisted.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    **1) Market-wide performance:**  
The crypto market saw mixed movements, with major large-cap assets like Bitcoin (-1.9%) and Ethereum (-3.19%) dipping over 24 hours but retaining weekly gains (+4.29% and +5.97%, respectively). Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) held steady, reflecting muted volatility. Mid-caps like Toncoin (+0.57% daily, +34.46% weekly) and BNB (+2.26% daily, +9.63% weekly) outperformed, while Pi (-7.39% daily, -34.17% weekly) and Solana (-4.87% daily) lagged.  

**2) Key movers (price, volume):**  
Toncoin (TON) surged 34.46% weekly, supported by elevated volume ($283M). BNB (+9.63% weekly) and Bitget Token (+13.15% weekly) saw bullish momentum. Conversely, Pi (PI) collapsed -34.17% weekly despite high volume ($370M). Solana (-4.87%), Chainlink (-4.44%), and Hyperliquid (-6.07%) faced sharp daily corrections.  

**3) Dominant trends:**  
Mid-caps (e.g., TON, BNB, UNI) outpaced large-caps, signaling potential sector rotation toward altcoins. Weekly gains in DeFi tokens (Uniswap +16.99%, Polkadot +10.99%) contrasted with short-term pullbacks, suggesting profit-taking. Stablecoin volumes (USDT: $63.5B, USDC: $10.7B) remained elevated, indicating cautious capital allocation. Bitcoin’s dominance (60.54%) held steady, underscoring its resilience despite near-term bearish pressure.
