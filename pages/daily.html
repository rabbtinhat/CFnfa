                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. stocks plummeted sharply on Friday, with the Dow (-1.7%), S&P 500 (-2%), and Nasdaq (-2.7%) dragged by tech and consumer discretionary sectors. Inflation concerns intensified as February’s core PCE rose 0.4% MoM, exceeding forecasts. Consumer sentiment hit a November 2022 low, while Trump’s auto tariff threats and April 2 reciprocal tariff deadline spooked markets. Treasury yields dipped (10-year at 4.25%) as investors fled to safety. CoreWeave’s Nasdaq debut (ticker: CRWV) closed flat amid AI trade skepticism, while Microsoft and Nvidia fell due to exposure risks. Bitcoin sank 4% to $84,000 amid risk-off sentiment.

                <h2>Europe Market</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets faced pressure as Trump’s 25% auto tariffs and threats of “far larger” EU/Canada levies rattled trade-sensitive sectors. Auto stocks like Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen declined, while the STOXX Europe 600 mirrored global risk aversion. Investors weighed Fed uncertainty and Atlanta GDPNow’s revised -2.8% Q1 GDP forecast, though EU-specific data remained sparse. The euro and pound weakened slightly against the dollar amid tariff escalation fears. European Central Bank policy outlook stayed muted as global growth concerns overshadowed regional inflation dynamics.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets fell broadly, with Japan’s Nikkei (-2%) and South Korea’s KOSPI (-1.5%) hit by U.S. auto tariffs. Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai dropped 3-5% on supply chain risks. Thailand’s SET halted trading post-Myanmar earthquake, last down 1.05%. China’s Alibaba surged 60% YTD on AI optimism and Xi’s pro-business stance, offsetting broader regional declines. Beijing intensified Central Asia trade ties to counter U.S. tariffs. Australia’s ASX 200 dipped 0.8% ahead of May elections, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng underperformed amid lingering growth concerns.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech led U.S. declines as CoreWeave’s IPO raised $1.5B (below target), citing AI adoption risks and customer concentration (77% revenue from Microsoft). Nvidia fell 1.7%, while Microsoft dropped 3%. Lululemon sank 14% on weak guidance, signaling consumer spending fatigue. AI optimism buoyed Alibaba (+60% YTD) amid open-source model traction and $50B AI infrastructure plans. Applied Materials rose on Jefferies’ upgrade (low China exposure). AppLovin rebounded 9% post-Muddy Waters short report sell-off. OpenAI’s ChatGPT image tool faced server strain, highlighting GPU demand pressures.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) The crypto market faced broad declines, with the total top 30 market cap dropping ~$200B (-7.3%) from yesterday. Bitcoin (-4.1%) and Ethereum (-6.6%) led losses, dragging large caps lower. Most assets underperformed their 7-day trends, signaling accelerated selling pressure.  

2) Major decliners included Sui (-11.7%), Chainlink (-9.8%), and Avalanche (-9.3%) with above-average volume spikes, indicating panic selling. Mid-caps like Polkadot (-8.3%) and Litecoin (-7.3%) fell harder than BTC. Stablecoins saw net inflows - USDT volume surged 27% as investors sought shelter.  

3) The selloff reversed recent momentum - assets like Solana (+8.9% 7D gain yesterday) turned negative (-0.3% 7D today). Large caps showed relative strength (BTC dominance +0.3%) while altcoins bled, suggesting risk-off rotation. Bearish divergence emerged as falling prices coincided with rising volumes, particularly in derivatives-focused tokens like Hyperliquid (-13.3%).
