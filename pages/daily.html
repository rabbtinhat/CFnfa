                <div class="market-content">
                    U.S. stocks closed sharply lower, led by a 2% Nasdaq decline amid escalating trade tensions. The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, and the Dow dropped 0.4%, driven by President Trump’s impending auto tariffs (25% on non-U.S. cars) and recession fears. Tech giants Nvidia (-5.7%) and Tesla (-5.6%) underperformed due to China-related sales risks and tariff sensitivity. Treasury yields rose as CFO surveys indicated a 60% probability of a H2 2025 recession. GameStop slid 8% post-market after announcing a $1.3B bitcoin purchase plan. Durable goods orders (+0.9%) beat expectations but failed to offset broader concerns.

                <div class="market-content">
                    European markets saw mixed reactions, with the Stoxx 600 gaining 0.67% despite U.S. tariff risks. Auto stocks faced pressure as EU registrations for Tesla fell 40% YoY in February. SAP (+1.33%) briefly became Europe’s most valuable company ($343B market cap) amid tech resilience. Copper prices surged to records on accelerated U.S. tariff plans, benefiting mining sectors. German business sentiment improved, lifting the DAX 1.13%. However, EU automakers like Volkswagen and BMW dipped on fears of retaliatory tariffs. Investors monitored U.S.-EU trade developments ahead of Trump’s April 2 tariff deadline.

                <div class="market-content">
                    Asian markets grappled with U.S.-China trade tensions, particularly impacting tech and EV sectors. Nvidia fell 5.7% as China’s environmental rules excluded its H20 chips, threatening $12B in China data-center sales. BYD surpassed Tesla in 2024 revenue ($107B vs. $97.7B), driven by hybrid vehicle demand. Japan’s Nikkei underperformed amid yen volatility, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rebounded slightly on Alibaba’s cloud investments. Chinese EV stocks faced dual pressures from domestic competition and potential U.S. tariffs. Copper futures rose 3% in Shanghai, tracking global supply concerns tied to accelerated U.S. levies.

                <h2>Technology Sector</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    Tech led losses as Nasdaq slid 2%: Nvidia (-5.7%) faced China chip restrictions, while Tesla (-5.6%) was hit by EU sales declines and tariff risks. Microsoft canceled U.S./EU data-center projects, spooking AI infrastructure stocks (Vertiv -11%). Meta and Google absorbed vacated data-center capacity, per TD Cowen. SailPoint (-1%) dipped despite beating earnings, citing unclear market reaction. Cybersecurity demand remained strong, with SailPoint guiding 18% sales growth. GameStop’s bitcoin plan (+11% pre-announcement) mirrored MicroStrategy’s strategy. Fears of AI overvaluation resurfaced after Marvell’s weak outlook and DeepSeek’s chatbot launch.

                <h2>Crypto</h2>
                <div class="market-content">
                    1) **Market-wide performance**: The crypto market saw a corrective pullback, with the total top 30 market cap declining slightly. Bitcoin (-0.69%) and Ethereum (-2.71%) led the downturn, though BTC maintained a 1.87% weekly gain. Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI) held their pegs without volatility.

2) **Key movers**: Meme coins outperformed - Dogecoin (+2.16%, $207M volume) and Shiba Inu (+3.74%, $573M volume) rose despite broader weakness. Sui (+7.11%) and Toncoin (+1.79%) were mid-cap standouts. Notable decliners included MANTRA (-4.72%) and Hyperliquid (-13.22%), both reversing recent gains. Solana (-4.4%) and Avalanche (-4.15%) saw profit-taking after strong weekly rallies (+3.14% and +14.03% 7D respectively).

3) **Dominant trends**: Sector rotation appeared with meme coins showing strength while smart contract platforms corrected. Large caps (BTC dominance 60.86%) faced pressure while select mid-caps (SUI, TON) rallied. Trading volumes dipped 10-20% across majors, suggesting reduced momentum. The 7D/24H performance divergence in SOL (-4.4% vs +3.14% weekly) and AVAX (-4.15% vs +14.03% weekly) indicates short-term profit-taking in recent outperformers.
